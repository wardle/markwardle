    <p>I firmly believe that Wales has potential to be the best place in the World for digitally-enabled healthcare and innovation.</p>

<p>Our “Once-for-Wales” task and finish group has finished its work and we have recommended a new Welsh Technical Standards Board (WTSB) be set up to define and mandate the technical and semantic standards for interoperability across our principality. We have recognised that there are many services and system functions, such as patient demographics and identity, that should be provided nationally for every citizen in Wales across all of our health and social care organisations.</p>

<p>Likewise, we recognise that we must be able to exchange information with others, such as health organisations outside of Wales. This is vital for patients who live on the border between Wales and England, and for those specialist service providers who care for patients from a different region. For instance, many specialist services in North Wales are provided from Liverpool, and we send patients from South Wales to either Bristol, Birmingham or London for highly specialist support.</p>

<p>But information exchange is not simply limited to health. We need to communicate with and build workflows across multiple disciplinary ‘borders’ including social care, the third-sector, academic researchers and service planners. Such communications must be acceptable to citizens, requiring implicit or explicit consent depending on purpose and level of aggregation.</p>

<p>Interoperability is not something that can be “added later on” but must be designed at the outset, understanding that we must not only support technical interoperability but exchange semantically-meaningful information within a broader legal data sharing environment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Legal interoperability covers the broader environment of laws, policies, procedures and
cooperation agreements needed to allow the seamless exchange of information
between different organisations, regions and countries.</p>

  <p>Semantic interoperability refers to the ability to ensure that the precise meaning of
exchanged information is unambiguously interpretable by any other system, service or
user.</p>

  <p>Technical interoperability means the ability of two or more information and
communication technology applications, to accept data from each other and perform a
given task in an appropriate and satisfactory manner without the need for extra
operator intervention.</p>

  <p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health//sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/ev_20121107_wd02_en.pdf">eHealth Governance Initiative - Discussion paper on semantic and technical interoperability</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="digital-ecosystems">Digital ecosystems</h1>

<p>At the same time,  many of us in Wales recognise the need to prioritise our limited resources and form partnerships with others. We cannot do everything ourselves and, just as when one is creating a new startup venture, bring in partners who have strengths to complement our own.</p>

<p>As such, Welsh Government have funded a new <a href="https://www.lifescienceshubwales.com/dhew/">Digital Health Ecosystem</a> bringing together the Life Sciences Hub in Cardiff with the NHS Wales Informatics Service to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>accelerate the delivery and adoption of the latest digital solutions to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs</li>
  <li>create a pathway for access to health and care data</li>
  <li>foster innovation from all stakeholders, encouraging cross sector cooperation and implementation</li>
  <li>support the development of new products and services to drive business growth, job security and creation, ensuring prosperity for all.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="prioritisation-and-strategy">Prioritisation and strategy</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Strategies focus resources, energy, and attention on some objectives rather than others. Unless
collective ruin is imminent, a change in strategy will make some people worse off. Hence there will be powerful 
forces opposed to almost any change in strategy.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>…</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When organisations are unable to make new strategies - when people evade the work of choosing among different paths into the future - then you get vague mom-and-apple-pie goals that everyone can agree on. Such goals are direct evidence of leadership’s insufficient will or political power to make or enforce hard choices. Put differently, universal buy-in usually signals the absence of choice.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Good Strategy, Bad strategy” by Richard Rumelt.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="on-partnerships-and-trust">On partnerships and trust</h1>

<p>Similarly, we also conclude that mandating single user-facing applications across all organisations risks unnecessarily stifling innovation, particularly if all new developments can only occur through a single “portal”.</p>
