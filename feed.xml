&lt;p&gt;My manifesto has five core principles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don’t have all of the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only constant is change.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We should work in the open; we must be transparent and foster rigorous debate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We set broad top-down principles and standards, but empower trusted teams who have freedom to deliver but also take responsibility for their work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We must deliver, deliver and then deliver again; we iterate, we improve and we continuously learn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology is a tool; our work in developing and deploying technology is not an end in itself but instead, its use should help us to deliver our wider strategic aims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It therefore follows that our goals must be to deliver technology as quickly and as safely as possible. Some argue that those goals are contradictory, but evidence from the highest performing technology teams shows that adding more processes and procedures designed to add safety has the paradoxical effect of worsening safety. As such, we need to rethink our approach to project management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our culture must be open so that we are transparent about our success and our failures. We must foster constructive debate. Challenge me to defend this approach and let’s all learn from it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is seductive to think that, as a small nation, we should centralise. It is similarly seductive to think that we lower risk by centralisation. Neither are true. Getting more and more engagement to understand requirements up front &lt;em&gt;does not work&lt;/em&gt;. The best approach is to deliver functioning technology and then improve it based on rapid and continuous feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As none of us have all of the answers and we work in a complex and highly adaptive group of organisations, we must recognise that any credible plan must, itself, be adaptive and capable of evolutionary change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, we must recognise that one size truly does not fit all. While Wales is of similar size to a strategic health authority in England, our structures and existing technological investments are much more complex. One of our goals must be to safely reduce needless variation, and yet at the same time foster innovation, permitting that new work to scale across all of our services when it is proven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not one approach solves everything we face; instead we should buy products that are an established solution to a problem and focus our in-house work on solving problems that only the public sector can do. That means blending different approaches and being transparent about the decisions we make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The steps we need to take are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;focus on our customers; that means professionals &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; patients. We align our information technology work with our wider service goals.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;modularisation, so we break apart our architecture into smaller, discrete components that can be developed independently of the whole.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;create small, cross-functional teams who are tasked with delivering those modules, iteratively, building in quality and safety from the onset.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;adopt open standards, so that we standardise the interactions between our modules speeding up delivery by permitting parallel developments and limiting the number of people from different teams who need to be involved in any decision.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;prioritise tools to acquire, store and make sense of meaningful clinical data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;become open by default; for example, one of our first debates must be whether it makes any sense to run two data centres in Wales. Let’s debate!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;focus on developer productivity, let’s copy the architectural and cultural practices from the most productive technology teams.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we should consider developers in three broad categories, and treat them equally with the same tools, frameworks and documentation available, those providing shared national services and components, those working in and across health boards developing solutions using the national toolbox of services and those outside of the NHS in a thriving commercial and academic ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I truly believe that Wales could have the best health information technology in the World. We are small, we have a unique and special health service that could be transformed by the safe and efficient deployment of technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we need to do things differently to what has been tried in the past. Almost all of my blog posts explore these issues in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell me what you think, let’s debate… and &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;direct care,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;management and quality improvement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;clinical research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is insufficient to simply exchange information at a technical level, but we must aim for &lt;em&gt;semantic&lt;/em&gt; interoperability so that we exchange &lt;em&gt;meaningful data&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I say meaningful data, I mean data that has meaning and can be used for decisions, in order to reduce uncertainty about those decisions. Those decisions may be made by a professional, by a patient or carer, or much more likely, shared decisions among groups of those individuals. Those decisions may be clinical, such as should we start anticoagulation to prevent a stroke, or administrative, such as how many patients should we book into that clinic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when I use the term meaningful data, I also  include the ability to use software to process that information; it is computable. It is important to understanding the benefits of computable information, because computer software is quite simply the best way to make sense of large amounts of information. Making data computable means our clinical work can become &lt;em&gt;data-driven&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making our data computable means that machines can help in processing and understanding, and with the advent of machine learning, even make or suggest decisions based on information. But this post isn’t about machine learning, although it is, I believe, a foundational step for the appropriate and meaningful development and application of machine learning in healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this blog post is about how we can record information in a way that is useful to both humans and machines. For humans it should mean data can be entered more quickly and for machines, it permits better processing so that they can support us humans!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-to-be-data-driven&quot;&gt;How to be data-driven&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SNOMED CT is a comprehensive terminology and ontology for use in healthcare and it forms an important component of the solution to semantic interoperability. I implemented SNOMED CT in a electronic patient record system and it has been live and running for clinical use in the UK since 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SNOMED CT model consists of three core entities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;concepts, represents a unique concept&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;descriptions, represents synonyms for a concept&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;relationships, represents relationships between concepts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve written extensively about SNOMED-CT on this blog; the best way of understanding the ontology is to browse using an &lt;a href=&quot;https://termbrowser.nhs.uk&quot;&gt;online browser&lt;/a&gt; but SNOMED International provide &lt;a href=&quot;https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCSTART/1.+Introduction&quot;&gt;a useful introductory guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;concepts&quot;&gt;Concepts&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many concepts represent a single independent concept, but many are actually &lt;em&gt;compound&lt;/em&gt;, representing a number of concepts combined into a meaningful whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cholecystectomy&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://termbrowser.nhs.uk/?perspective=full&amp;amp;conceptId1=38102005&quot;&gt;38102005&lt;/a&gt;) is a single concept representing removal of the gallbladder. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Laparoscopic cholecystectomy&lt;/code&gt; is single concept representing removal of the gallbladder with a laparoscope (&lt;a href=&quot;https://termbrowser.nhs.uk/?perspective=full&amp;amp;conceptId1=45595009&quot;&gt;45595009&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A SNOMED CT &lt;em&gt;expression&lt;/em&gt; combines concepts without needing every possible combination of concepts to be created within the terminology. For example,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;80146002|appendectomy|
   :260870009|priority|=25876001|emergency|,
   425391005|using access device|=86174004|laparoscope|
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;represents performing an appendicectomy as an emergency using an laparoscope. We could add this as a distinct single concept into SNOMED CT but that would result in a combinatorial explosion; that means we’d have to have single concepts representing all possible permutations which is simply not practical. However, mainly for historical reasons or to ease implementation, SNOMED CT does already contains many single concepts that combines multiple concepts into one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, SNOMED CT expressions are a powerful way of refining a concept with additional information, creating, in effect, a clinical phrase. This technique is called &lt;em&gt;post-coordination&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-not-use-post-coordination&quot;&gt;Why not use post-coordination?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have usually advocated keeping the implementation of SNOMED CT simple by using only pre-coordinated concepts. My concerns about using post-coordination have been that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it added complexity to end-users in terms of selection and display of terms,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it made data storage more difficult, and would break referential integrity in my own system.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it would complicate using those terms at a computational level e.g. in automated decision support.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we gain significant value simply from recording pre-coordinated concepts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is (1) and (3) that concerned me most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in my own electronic health record software, users don’t know that they are selecting SNOMED terms; they start typing and it autocompletes or simply choose an option using a pop-up, choose a part of the anatomy from a picture or a term is imputed on the basis of other data entered. Adding complexity in adding refinements or qualifiers or embedding expressions worried me. I wanted to make SNOMED CT invisible to end-users and yet enable new decision support and analytics capabilities, hitherto not possible using unstructured free-text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t conceived of a simple way to make using SNOMED invisible if I created functionality to build expressions; I now think differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;information-models&quot;&gt;Information models&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in the majority of cases, I think many uses of post-coordination such as qualification or refinement or additional information should instead be a function of the wider information model in which the SNOMED CT concept is recorded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the FHIR definition of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hl7.org/fhir/condition.html&quot;&gt;Condition&lt;/a&gt;, which includes metadata about the problem/diagnosis concept is shown here:
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/snomed-postcoord/fhir-condition.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Fhir Condition&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It includes information relating to status (active/inactive etc), verification (provisional, differential) and severity (severe, moderate, mild), as well as information about the condition’s onset and abatement (remission/resolution).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we use post-coordination without carefully considering the consequences and their mitigation, given that there is an overlap between information recorded within an expression and the wider information model, we risk duplication, complexity and inconsistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;computing-attributes&quot;&gt;Computing attributes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are clearly situations where refining a concept with additional information would be helpful. For example, we really wanted to be able to add a more specific anatomical location when we recorded that a patient had a brain abscess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SNOMED-CT ontology helps us, at the computational level, determine &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; “cerebral abscess” can be refined:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://termbrowser.nhs.uk/?perspective=full&amp;amp;conceptId1=60404007&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cerebral abscess&lt;/code&gt; (60404007)&lt;/a&gt; is an abscess in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we can determine a way to &lt;em&gt;refine&lt;/em&gt; this concept using post-coordination to specifically give the location. The ontology provides, as part of its model, attribute relationships for this concept, at a computational level:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; Is a (attribute)                   -&amp;gt; Abscess of brain (disorder)	
 Associated morphology (attribute)  -&amp;gt; Abscess (morphologic abnormality)
 Finding site (attribute)           -&amp;gt; Cerebral structure (body structure)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, we can see that we can refine the concept &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cerebral abscess&lt;/code&gt; with a finding site that is a child of the concept &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Cerebral structure (body structure)&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://termbrowser.nhs.uk/?perspective=full&amp;amp;conceptId1=83678007&quot;&gt;83678007&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, computationally, we can offer a choice to the end-user to refine this concept with any finding site, such as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Structure of parahippocampal gyrus&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://termbrowser.nhs.uk/?perspective=full&amp;amp;conceptId1=13989007&quot;&gt;13989007&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, we can add refinements as a result of our concept being in one of the nine main SNOMED CT hierarchies. The attributes appropriate for each hierarchy are listed &lt;a href=&quot;https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCSTART/6.+SNOMED+CT+Concept+Model&quot;&gt;on the SNOMED International concept model documentation&lt;/a&gt;. For example, a clinical finding can be qualified by adding concepts representing a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Finding Site&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Causative Agent&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Severity&lt;/code&gt; among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, we can add refinements because of the existence of our concept within a certain reference set. For example, there is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://termbrowser.nhs.uk/?perspective=full&amp;amp;conceptId1=723264001&quot;&gt;laterality reference set&lt;/a&gt; that tells us which concepts can be lateralised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is therefore straightforward to imagine that, if a cerebral abscess is entered by a user as a diagnostic concept, we might configure our user interface or natural language parser to look for and refine that diagnostic concept with additional information relating to finding site, appropriately limited to the brain using subsumption, given that we have entered cerebral abscess, and offering a choice of laterality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we can see that location, laterality and causative agents &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be very appropriate options for refinement, but should we let users post-coordinate diagnostic concepts with a type of ```Severity’’’? This matters because we need to think about how we write software to process these terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;equivalence-and-the-importance-of-meaning&quot;&gt;Equivalence and the importance of meaning&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key issue with processing SNOMED CT, either as pre-coordinated terms or as expressions, is to ensure that we can process &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means that, in any implementation of SNOMED CT, whether using only pre-coordinated terms or post-coordination to create an expression, we need to handle equivalence at not just the level of SNOMED, but also take into account the wider information model, providing the context in which that concept or expression sits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a HL7 FHIR representation of a condition looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;resourceType&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Condition&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;Resource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;meta,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;implicitRules,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;language&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;DomainResource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;contained,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;extension,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;modifierExtension&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#codeableconcept&quot;&gt;CodeableConcept&lt;/a&gt; is a complex HL7 FHIR type that provides a reference to an arbitrary terminology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/snomed-postcoord/codeable-concept.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Codeable Concept&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens if we put a concept representing “SEVERE” as the severity in the FHIR model but record a post-coordinated SNOMED CT expression of “MILD” as a qualifier of our diagnostic concept?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;meaningful-data-in-context&quot;&gt;Meaningful data, in context&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means our analytics, for direct individual care, processing data as part of an electronic health record in real-time, or for quality improvement, service management or research use, must interpret the meaning of SNOMED CT concepts and expressions &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; the wider information model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do we need from our software?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need to be able to process an arbitrary SNOMED concepts, provide the standard attribute relationships to client software so that those developers can easily understand how to refine, for example, a diagnostic term. This should include the value sets or necessary search constraints so that only appropriate values can be used for any specific attribute (e.g. if you are refining an anatomical location in the central nervous system, your values should only be anatomical locations within the central nervous system!)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need a set of tools that can parse SNOMED expressions into a useful internal representation and vice versa, so that expressions can be persisted and exchanged as well as permitting the information to be used effectively by humans and machines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need to be able to process an arbitrary SNOMED concept or expression and normalise it into a canonical expression so that it can be used for analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need tools to be able to offer additional refinement of SNOMED concepts and expressions by virtue of the wider information model in which they sit. For example, normalisation of a concept within a FHIR condition model could be automatically refined by the appropriate attributes from the wider model, such as severity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, I have been working on a set of open-source tools that not only support deriving understanding of meaning from pre-coordinated single terms in isolation, but from SNOMED expressions and those terms &lt;em&gt;in their wider context&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of this work, I have made use of the Google HL7 FHIR protobuf definitions, which can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/fhir&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and are now vendored in the go-terminology code repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next blog post in this series will cover the details of a practical implementation. Like all standards, it is only with the development and availability of quality (open-source) implementations that a standard can truly become valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This explicitly recognises that, while we have already seen remarkable changes to our lives, our societies and our cultures as a result of software, and the microprocessors on which they rely, we are actually only at the beginning of our journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://a16z.com/2016/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/&quot;&gt;“Software is eating the World”&lt;/a&gt; said Marc Andreessen, referring to the fact that in every aspect of our lives, software has disrupted the status quo and has revolutionised industries, sometimes quietly, and sometimes by storm. Commercially, we have seen businesses that have put software at the heart of their business overtaking incumbents slower to adopt technology and slower to realise the role of technology as an intrinsic foundation of all they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work as a full-time consultant neurologist caring for patients with a range of neurological illnesses. Like most senior clinical staff, have a range of academic and leadership roles in addition to my clinical practice; in all of these roles, I see, first-hand, how the right technology could help my work and, most importantly, help the patients I directly care as well as the populations I serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what do we mean by nebulous terms such as ‘digital’ and ‘technology’ and are we right to think about a digital ‘revolution’, particularly in my own field, healthcare? After all, the technologies at our disposal continuously change improve and we have ever more computing power at our fingertips. The word ‘revolution’ suggests a fundamental and relatively sudden change and while it is true, the maturity of our digital tools sometimes advances quickly, such as near ubiquity of smart phones in the developed world, would we not be better to talk about the “digital era”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But whether we talk about a “digital revolution” or the start of a journey into a new “digital era”, what do we actually mean by “digital”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would argue that the starting point in trying to understand the implications of true digital thinking, in any industry,  is our ability to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;transfer and process information to make it accessible and useful&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;rapid-and-sophisticated-processing--faster-learning&quot;&gt;Rapid and sophisticated processing = faster learning&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But weren’t we were able to transfer and process information before we had digital tools?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, most of us in healthcare still rely on paper notes but that doesn’t stop our teams collecting piles of them to audit an important quality measure of our work.  So perhaps we need to refine our understanding of the “digital revolution”, to explicitly recognise the importance of &lt;em&gt;speed, accuracy and sophistication of our processing&lt;/em&gt; enabling us to make our information ever more useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transition from film to digital cameras is a useful example of how digital technology has impacted our lives. The digital camera speeds up processing; you no longer wait weeks to see the pictures you have taken but instead see your pictures immediately, but digital tools do more than simply improve the speed of feedback, I can now also crop my images and share with friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when we talk about “accessible and useful”, aren’t we actually talking about &lt;em&gt;creating value&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;improving outcomes&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcomes in photography that are important to me are recording a cherished memory and sharing with those closest to me, and digital tools support these outcomes in a way that was not as easy with traditional film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the benefit of digital technologies over paper-based processes is that the feedback loops between our decision, in this case to take a photograph, and the outcome, can be made so much more quickly. With the right digital tools, my understanding of the best aperture and shutter speed to use in those conditions and in that situation improves; I learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting the right information at the right time, synthesised appropriately to make it useful, informs our learning and therefore our ability to make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And digital is, quite simply, the best way to enable a learning culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-continuous-learning-system&quot;&gt;A continuous learning system&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is why we are at the cusp of a true transformational change, because so many of our procedures and policies, our structures and services and even our budgets and planning, in so many industries, are rooted in the pre-digital era. That means our purchasing or budgeting decisions for solutions to problems are made on a cycle involving years. We plan projects because the pre-digital era required us to meticulous plan our work, deliver what was needed and then evaluate what we did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, digital is an important enabler of changing our mindset in all areas of our work, in healthcare and in other industries, mainly as a result of the speed and acuity of the feedback we can create by the right use of technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lean methodologies teach us to defer decisions to the last &lt;em&gt;responsible&lt;/em&gt; moment, understanding that there is always uncertainty and delaying decisions permits time to gain more information and reduce that uncertainty. Agile methodologies teach us that we should be iterative in our work, breaking it up into small chunks and gaining constant feedback to guide continuous improvement. We should be adopting these principles not only in our work to develop healthcare software, but to manage and improve our services. Digital is a vital ingredient to support those methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, digital, and being data-driven, means our planning cycles should become shorter and shorter, because we’re using small focused interventions and data to constantly evaluate our hypotheses and build a continuously learning healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means changing the way we think about budgets and financing our work.  Similarly, our real-life prospectively recorded outcome data should be used to inform our clinical practice; we have small examples of how this can already be done but the potential of the digital era is to make such an approach ubiquitous by understanding the importance of routinely collected meaningful data and how it can be used to support decision making by patients and professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True digital transformation isn’t simply digitising our existing processes and replacing paper with a digital equivalent but instead, it is a complete change in mindset. We need to re-imagine our healthcare services with the benefit of the digital tools we have available to us and realise the value and improved outcomes that we can build on this data-driven foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;software-is-like-magic&quot;&gt;Software is like magic&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software is like magic, automating and systematising even complex tasks. My mission is to make the most effective use of software in healthcare, and I think we’ve barely even started that journey yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a new and vast array of technologies available to us, from enormous quantities of data to real-time analytics, machine learning and applied artificial intelligence, with computing power and different sources of data all growing exponentially. None of us know what the future holds, and none of us have all of the answers, so whether we are talking about ambient sensors or interacting with software using our voice, the essence of our digital work is not just the technology, but instead our ability to make use of data to learn and to inform our decision making. And that means learning how to build software that supports that goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we bring digital technologies into play, we speed up feedback on our actions and can perform complex processing tasks to make sense of burgeoning quantities of information and so “digital”, to me, is inextricably linked to becoming data-driven, because digital tools are the best way to combine and process information. That means understanding the best, evidence-based ways of creating and delivering safe, secure and valuable software code to end-users. And the best ways to deliver software like that is to use those same data-driven methodologies and build our software incrementally in small chunks with constant feedback to guide continuous improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;so-what-next&quot;&gt;So what next?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my view, our biggest risk is to think that we have all of the answers. Instead, we can set the broad principles to which we must work but build trusted teams to deliver against the outcomes we set, whether that be our healthcare services or the software that supports and enables transformation of those services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The true digital revolution will come when we focus on generating meaningful data and use appropriate tools to make sense of that data, to drive our decision making, to use those data to reduce our uncertainty about our decisions, so that, we, in whatever role we have, are supported to make the right judgments at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt;, and digital technology is an essential part of building a continuously learning culture, in whatever industry you work. And that is the essence of digital transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been asked to identify, assess, set and assure technical principles and standards in NHS Wales. That means we need to build a catalogue of standards, including standards that are already in use as well as standards that should be used for new developments. We must recognise a need for pragmatism, so a catalogue must include not only information about that technical standard but how it should be implemented and used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this meeting, we discussed how to build safe, reliable, functioning processes to assess a technical standard for use within NHS Wales. It is important to recognise that this blog post is a snapshot of my reflections. As a board with an explicit adopted principle to be open and transparent and adopt an iterative approach to our work, fostering a culture of continuous improvement, these notes are simply that: notes and a work-in-progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that caveat, what broad range of issues did we discuss?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;things-to-consider&quot;&gt;Things to consider&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any standard, we discussed a range of factors that might need to be teased out during any open, transparent process we wanted to design:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what is the user need? what are the use-cases?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;is the standard already used?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;is the standard already deprecated?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;are others using, working on or interested in this standard already?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what can we learn from others using or working in domain in which the standard operates, and how do we engage with others who are using, working on or interested in this domain?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;is the scope of the functional requirements correct, or does it need to be broadened or made more specific?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;is the standard supported or due to be supported by the market? do we need to explore the market?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what scoring mechanisms (e.g. procurement) can we use to discourage the use of standards at their end-of-life, and likewise, what can we do to drive market adoption?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what are the false barriers to entry?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what are the lifecycle issues to consider? (draft, draft-for-use, standard, deprecated but still in use, deprecated and not for use, planned?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how does one identify or drive traction of a standard?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how do we judge the need and the content of a standard, particularly for new developments?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;architecture-and-interoperability&quot;&gt;Architecture and interoperability&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we think of technical standards, we thought it helpful to consider the different places in which those standards might be used for interoperability. Interoperability is how we make make computer systems or software exchange information. Most of us recognise that simply exchanging information is insufficient but instead we must aim for meaningful (semantic) interoperability in which systems exchange information and make use of that information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost all computer systems try to break down complex problems into discrete modular components, each of which do a limited set of things very well and traditional applications stitches these together into what appears to be a cohesive whole. Modularity means that teams can work semi-independently of one another and so long as they interact appropriately (at technical, legal and human levels).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interoperability is usually used to define the interactions between distributed systems and software. This enables technologies such as the World Wide Web, in which your computer has no difficulty in interacting with software running on a completely different computer somewhere else in the world to show you a web page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already use interoperability in healthcare as almost all health enterprises use a range of computer systems that need to be made to work together. A common, if old-fashioned example, is the use of HL7v2 to send messages regarding &lt;a href=&quot;http://healthstandards.com/blog/2006/10/05/what-is-an-adt-message/&quot;&gt;admissions, discharges and transfers&lt;/a&gt;. As a source system notifies dependent systems about a change by sending a message, we call this approach &lt;em&gt;push messaging&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Push messaging is well established within health enterprises and most have adopted a messaging fabric that acts as a safe bus to transport messages across systems with high levels of scalability, monitoring and queuing as well as often providing assertions as to reliability and performance. But there are problems with it. Dependent systems need to potentially deal with a constant influx of messages being sent to them and managing security is difficult. A source system sends out messages and therefore controlling which subscribed systems should be notified can prove challenging; many push enterprises adopt a patient-of-interest list that defines a subset of patients for whom a target system should receive messages. Inherent in this architectural design, is the concept that each application maintains its own state, with messages being used to keep disparate disconnected systems consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, modern enterprises have moved towards a model of “pull messaging”, in which a system retrieves data from another and we decouple software logic from data so that many applications and services become stateless. This means that security checks become much easier because we can understand, at the time of the request to retrieve that data, which application is making the request on behalf of which user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sketched a version of this schematic in order to try to understand the use cases and the difference between a “pull” and “push” approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/open-platform/wtsb-architecture-standard.png&quot; alt=&quot;Wtsb Architecture Standard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a laboratory test result is pushed from a laboratory information management service (LIMS) and is stored in a vendor-neutral archive. In Wales, we call this the Welsh Results Reporting Service (WRRS). We could expose that archive as a FHIR diagnostic report &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hl7.org/fhir/diagnosticreport.html&quot;&gt;https://www.hl7.org/fhir/diagnosticreport.html&lt;/a&gt; as a microservice. Multiple independent services like that are blended together into a cohesive whole to create what appears to be an enterprise-wide cohesive API acting as a gateway and hiding (abstracting) the underlying implementation. Importantly, if we wanted to show laboratory results from other centres, we could either use one of two approaches to provide a unified view:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a federate/delegate/aggregate model, in which a service accepts a request for data, sends that request to multiple other private services, collects the responses to create a unified view&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a shared repository model, in which all centres push data into a shared repository via health information exchange.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach to architecture means that, while we have a LIMS that does not support HL7 FHIR and appropriate UK-wide shared profiles, we can still expose our laboratory data via HL7 FHIR. Once LIMS is replaced by a version that natively supports the more modern technical standards, we can deploy and existing modern applications &lt;em&gt;do not need to be modified in order to continue to run&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important considerations are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;use of vendor neutral data repositories&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;move towards an application programming interface (API) approach built on open standards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;understand that need to liberate data from legacy applications and make use of existing infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;existing legacy includes tightly-coupled bespoke integrations that do not fit into this schematic. Such an approach needs to be deprecated in favour of a more modular loosely coupled architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, we surely need to consider technical standards at multiple levels of our architecture, taking into account existing infrastructure and a clear future direction. This is shown graphically with the arrows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that the future of electronic health records is based on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;open standards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;distributed systems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;lightweight applications&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;shared common services for data and logic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;domain-driven modelling for clinical and administrative data, as well as clinical workflow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;process&quot;&gt;Process&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So given these considerations, how can we define a process that we can use in order to make rapid, pragmatic process while keeping within the broad principles and cohesive, credible technical architecture for our health and care data?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We worked through an example request for a standard - one of our colleagues from Aneurin Bevan submitted a request for a “Technical standard to support exchange of eObservations information using HL7 version 2 (HL7v2) messages”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a really useful example, and it led to a draft standards assessment process which I have drawn out here: 
notes
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/open-platform/wtsb-process.png&quot; alt=&quot;Wtsb Process&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the important considerations is to ensure the scope is defined, particularly in relation to high level clinical requirements - &lt;em&gt;user need&lt;/em&gt;. Understanding the alignment between information technology and our wider strategic objectives is critical. For this technical standard, we need to understand &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; we are being asked to help with eObservations and put that in context of our wider architectural and technical infrastructure plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was immediately clear that there was uncertainty about the scope of this request, as it specifically requested an NHS Wales standard on the format of HL7 v2 messages. In my view, we must broaden the scope to understand the wider clinical need, perhaps in terms of user stories, to see that what we are trying to solve is not simply exchanging HL7v2 messages but providing a wider framework for handling and making use of eObservation data. As a result, this request could be broadened to include technical standards for HL7 FHIR resources representing those data as well as HL7v2 messages that are sent by applications and services that do not, as yet, support HL7 FHIR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our plan now is to draft a more broad eObservations technical standards paper to include some of the factors outlined in my process diagram to see whether the process works and is helpful. I will write another blog post when we have learnt more about this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I would like to re-iterate the importance of a learning culture in our work: we adopted the GDS design principles. One of those is the use of iteration and incremental improvement. While you might consider such an agile approach for our software development processes, I would argue that we also need to approach our wider technological leadership and management approaches in an agile way; that means we test our assumptions and make incremental improvements to the way we work. This post is my attempt to embrace that approach. Let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Our September NHS Wales Technical Standards Board was held on the 27th September.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Building an open health and care platform for Wales</title><link href="https://www.wardle.org/strategy/2018/10/02/open-platform-wales.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Building an open health and care platform for Wales" /><published>2018-10-02T16:15:15+01:00</published><updated>2018-10-02T16:15:15+01:00</updated><id>https://www.wardle.org/strategy/2018/10/02/open-platform-wales</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.wardle.org/strategy/2018/10/02/open-platform-wales.html">&lt;p&gt;We should use information technology to better deliver our broad health and care objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means using information technology to support, improve, transform and re-imagine the delivery of health care; that means we must move away from delegating information technology to a separate department or even, as we do in Wales, a separate organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most modern enterprises have recognised the integral role information technology plays in operating their business. A failure in technology is a failure of business. That means services that have responsibility for delivering health and care objectives need to be responsible for the acquisition and development of technology used to support their work in delivering and improving care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alignment of information technology with business objectives requires a careful balance between top-down standardisation and enabling local, ‘bottom-up’ innovation. Standardisation, executed badly, creates fragility and inertia but when done well it creates an environment in which we can deliver technology at pace because we can decouple our developer teams and let them work independently. We know that pace of work is inversely proportional to the number of people who need to be involved in decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to re-imagine our organisational structures, governance and architecture to reflect modern information technology best practice. This means understanding the challenges we face:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we work in complex, constantly changing, heterogeneous clinical environments across Wales&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we need a single patient record with all of our user-facing applications giving a view on the same information.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we need to improve productivity; that means delivering technology at pace to meet the demands of the service&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we need to be able to make changes while adhering to legal, regulatory, safety and ethical standards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we need to share common national services avoiding wasteful duplication&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we need to permit local innovation and learning, particularly when we recognise that there is no already established &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; way of delivering business value, and rapidly scale success across organisations in Wales&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we need to understand that we have existing applications hosted nationally and locally, with health boards all at different levels of maturity, we want to harmonise but not suffocate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;both healthcare, and the design of software to support healthcare, must be data-driven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that we are not meeting these challenges in Wales; the Welsh Audit Office report is damning in the failure of delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-are-our-options&quot;&gt;What are our options?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three potential options for us:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Continue the status quo.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Buy an off-the-shelf electronic health record “mega-suite” from a large vendor and deploy across Wales, e.g. Cerner Millennium or Epic.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Change our strategy, creating an open health and care platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that there are substantial problems with information technology in healthcare in Wales including issues of governance, leadership, organisational structure and architecture. Is there anyone who thinks we can continue the status quo?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favoured approach is to recognise that our technical architecture determines our organisational and governance structures in Wales, and that architecture needs to be designed for&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;improving developer productivity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;supporting extremely high reliability as well as enabling testability, safety and performance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;permitting the use of structured, meaningful clinical data for direct care, service management, quality improvement as well as clinical research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, we can look at how other technology companies have achieved these goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;an-evolutionary-architecture&quot;&gt;An evolutionary architecture&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An evolutionary architecture is one that can adapt to change. We must understand that our work in technology will never be complete and we will need to continually improve, adapting to changing clinical need and new technological advances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the recognised characteristics of an evolutionary architecture is &lt;em&gt;modularity&lt;/em&gt;, in which we break-up our enterprise into modules, each with a well defined and usually constrained purpose. Modern architecture usually focuses on modularity at the domain-level while more old-fashioned service-orientated architectures are partitioned at a technical-level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NHS Wales currently uses the latter which means that end-to-end testing is very difficult and, in effect, one ends up with a distributed monolith and paradoxically makes change more difficult, the whole system less predictable and resilient. It might takes weeks to create developer or test environments that replicate live and it becomes difficult to keep those different environments synchronised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, domain-driven design recognises the need to modularise and align modules to meaningful constructs in the business domain; we recognise inherent partitions in functionality and then tightly define the interactions between those modules. In essence, we need a microservice based architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example platform services needed to support a modern electronic health record might be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patient demographic services, providing a single authoritative snapshot of demographic information about a single patient.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scheduling services, providing an aggregated view across multiple administrative systems to provide scheduling across multiple organisations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Staff identity services, providing canonical staff information, bringing together information information from the electronic staff record and national active directory&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clinical document repository, storing clinical documents and associated metadata&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Results repository, storing laboratory and radiology results&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Test requesting concierge service&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Security (authentication/authorisation) and logging services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clinical data repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scheduling services are a great example because they are needed to satisfy the vision from multiple workstreams of the Informed Health and Care strategy; patients and professionals need to be able to see and schedule appointments in order to deliver care more efficiently and more safely. At the moment, I login to Welsh Clinical Portal in Cwm Taf and see only Cwm Taf appointments, and login to Welsh Clinical Portal in Cardiff and see only Cardiff appointments. We have something wrong with our current architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there has been much good work in Wales on some of these core services, but these services need to be resourced appropriately and recognised as key enablers for building the next generation of user-facing applications. That means prioritising the deliver of these discrete services. Importantly, those services need to adopt open standards and be well-defined, loosely-coupled, documented and permit federation. As discrete modules, it becomes possible for use to run automated tests so that we know how our computing services provide accurate results and perform under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;contracts-abstract-computing-services&quot;&gt;Contracts: abstract computing services&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the fundamental characteristics of an evolutionary architecture is that developers are able to work independently from one another, as long as they work within the defined contracts that document the functionality needed and how that module will interact with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, our modules create an &lt;em&gt;abstractions&lt;/em&gt; of a computing service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstraction is an important software engineering principle which means that developers do not need to be concerned with how a service or application is implemented, only that it meets the agreed contracts. This is powerful because it acts to &lt;em&gt;decouple&lt;/em&gt; components meaning that they can be developed independently and in parallel, as long as they each work to the contracts specified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, the processes of simplification and abstraction mean reduce the interactions between discrete components within an architecture to a well-defined, constrained set of agreed contracts between parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those contracts may be technical, defining &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to interact at a technical level with the underlying services providing using that platform. Technical contracts usually define an &lt;em&gt;application programming interface&lt;/em&gt; (API), but those must be supplemented by a range of legal and regulatory contracts defining how those services may be used and for what purposes. In addition, those contracts can define how the different teams might work with one another and provide assurances regarding performance and reliability. In essence, the contracts document obligations for all parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to ensure that parties are working appropriately to those contracts by the use of automated tests and &lt;em&gt;fitness functions&lt;/em&gt;. Such an approach means that changes that break an agreed contract are recognised early in the development pipeline, rather than at a late stage. We should aim for an efficient flow of work from conception, development, testing, assurance to deployment, and we should question any step that delays or reverses that flow of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in our scheduling example, the developer team simply needs to deliver an API, probably based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hl7.org/fhir/appointment.html&quot;&gt;HL7 FHIR Appointment resource&lt;/a&gt;. Our initial version could simply provide a read-only view and satisfy the request by sending out its own request to all of the multiple patient administrative systems in Wales, collect and aggregate the results and return a unified view. That might work, but we would ensure fitness functions would assess not only the data returned but the performance metrics. We might expect to get results within 100 milliseconds, and so the team might instead create a vendor-neutral scheduling repository which takes a feed of data from each patient administrative system and, essentially, caches the results for performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important thing is that, from an architectural point of view, we don’t care. We set the specifications for that service and trust our team to work out how to deliver what we need, bringing together expertise from across organisations in Wales in order to safely deliver a service that meets our requirements. If the team improve the implementation, or create a new implementation, our client applications do not ever need to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;multiple-services-create-a-platform&quot;&gt;Multiple services create a platform&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A computing platform is the environment in which a piece of software is executed; they provide a range of software and data services that make it easier to develop applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the Apple developer platform provides a range of sophisticated building blocks that permit developers to create applications for mobile devices. Similarly, there are core services and frameworks that developers can use for common operations such as data storage or processing. This means developers can focus on delivering value to their end-users, building on a foundation of different building blocks that factor out some of the complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach means that applications become lightweight and often ephemeral, simply stitching together functionality from the underlying platform. A proprietary platform can lock developers into that platform, while open platforms, build using open standards can commoditise core computing functionality, foster innovation and create new marketplaces and ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we need to design our modules to work together to provide the building blocks of the next-generation of electronic health records, recognising that, when combined, those modules will provide a cohesive platform. That platform encwhile developed independently, those modules must be designed to work together to provide a platform&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not difficult to see the range of discrete computing services that are needed to create a functional health and care platform, but this model needs a change in culture and change in the way that we think about information technology, moving away from purchasing applications towards a separation of data from the software that acts upon those data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been some fantastic work in NHS Wales and there is a real appetite for cooperation and collaboration; we now need to work out how to take the next steps and build an open, standards-based computing platform for NHS Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;so-whats-next&quot;&gt;So what’s next?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We need a national platform group that will define the platform and the contractual obligations for each service, documenting the technical (API) interactions and other dependencies. This architectural design group will need to work closely with the technical and information standards boards.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We need multiple independent cross-functional teams each tasked with delivering discrete modular computing services that meet the standards defined by the national platform group. Those teams need to bring together developers with members of other teams, including security, operations, patient safety and assurance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We need a national applications group that to build example national applications, like a national modular portal, that can be used by all but, importantly, permit the different modules to be stitched together by developers irrespective of their location.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We need to recognise that our platform services three categories of developer: those working for NHS Wales developing national applications, those working for NHS Wales developing local applications (that might end up being scaled out if successful), and those working for academia and commercial organisations as part of our ecosystem. All three should be treated equally, using the same APIs. We cannot have a situation where internal and external developers are treated differently, or that successful local innovation cannot be easily scaled to other regions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our organisational and governance structures need to reflect these changes and we need to adequately resource, on a recurring basis, the ongoing development and improvement of these core national services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;and-what-about-a-portal&quot;&gt;And what about a portal?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do need a national portal. But our national strategy cannot be defined by a portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes little sense to duplicate portal functionality in different places, but each organisation needs a realistic convergence strategy that takes into account existing solutions and avoids long delays in providing functionality for our users. For example, we need to be able to embed portal functionality into emergency unit systems across Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we also need to ensure that our portal gives an accurate view of the single patient record; our focus must be on data. We cannot repeat the situation where different instances of portal provides the same view of different data. That means redesigning our national portal to be a lightweight, modular wrapper around national services; it too needs to use our national platform and provide common user-facing elements for use by all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To move towards a modular portal, we will embrace the idea that we will stitch together components of the national platform, including components of that portal, to meet our user needs. I believe that, given the right architecture, we will see a natural convergence as it will be possible to rapidly scale solutions developed locally to other organisations, as those new developments should use those standardised APIs. We should aim for true application portability, collaboration and cooperation. At the moment, local developments are difficult to scale because there isn’t truly, an open standards-based platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we cannot do this, then we should continue to consider procuring a mega-suite electronic health record system, because without change, we will be failing our staff and our patients in Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Separate application code from data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data, as in the patient record, must be longitudinal, immutable, federated, structured and meaningful, with a focus on the patient.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;User-facing applications should be lightweight and ephemeral, with a focus on process and workflow. Ideally build your applications out of re-usable components. Applications should almost always be stateless because state should be a function of your data and process models.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on user need. It subsumes everything else. That means helping professionals and patients to understand and refine their needs, as well as needing to create a culture of continuous improvement. Remember our work will never be complete.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build trust. Teams need to trust one another. Likewise, our systems need to be secure-by-design, ensuring consent and transparency are integral to the use of personal data; work to build public trust maximises the opportunities to use data to manage and improve our health services and advance our knowledge and understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build platforms and use use open standards, even if you think you only need a single user-facing application.  But, understand you are wrong, on multiple levels, to think one user-facing application will be sufficient for your needs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Modularisation is key; limit the surface area of interactions between those modules. Allow parallel independent development. That means understanding bounded contexts and two pizza rules. Think contracts: technical (API), performance, reliability, legal, regulatory and cultural. The more people who need to be involved in a decision, the slower you will deliver; your architecture and organisational structures should be designed to streamline that decision making.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understand that reliability and risk are not homogeneous across our enterprises. One size does not fit all. Remember that adding more process or checks, particularly if it requires manual checks from multiple stakeholders, can have a paradoxical effect on making systems &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; safe. Also never forget the frequently forgotten consequences of failure to deliver.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adopt a mobile first strategy; always consider multiple channels of interaction for your users and give due regard to digital inclusion. How are our tools going to support different types of users with different needs?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on developer velocity. The consequences of this is automating end-to-test testing and safety assurance, as well as doubling-down efforts to modularise services. We are not building something that will ever be complete so embrace and design for change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;developing expertise in data analytics and machine learning,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;structuring, generating and aggregating clinically meaningful clinical data, and,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;building robust evaluation processes using a combination of synthetic, randomised controlled and real-life implementation phases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An algorithm is simply a list of rules to follow in order to solve a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;machine-learning&quot;&gt;Machine learning&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning uses statistical methods to allow computers to learn from data; in effect, an algorithm is generated by a computer based on data.  Modern advances in computationally-intensive methods, such as deep learning, enabled by advances in computing power, have resulted in widespread recent adoption in many domains such as image and speech recognition and excitement about its potential use in healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning is already being used in fields outside of image and speech recognition. For example, in 2016, Google DeepMind built a automated recommendation algorithm to improve the energy efficiency of Google’s data centres; the algorithm analyses data from thousands of sensors and is optimised to minimise energy consumption. After two years, with the benefit of real-world experience as well as a range of additional safety measures, the teams took the &lt;a href=&quot;https://deepmind.com/blog/safety-first-ai-autonomous-data-centre-cooling-and-industrial-control/&quot;&gt;decision to make the system directly implement its recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. As an adaptive algorithm tasked with optimising energy efficiency, the teams have demonstrated an improvement with performance improves over time, as a result of more data being available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google DeepMind’s AlphaGo &lt;a href=&quot;https://deepmind.com/blog/exploring-mysteries-alphago/&quot;&gt;took on and defeated one of the World champions of the game Go&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than simply applying a brute force, combinatorial approach to generate the best moves from a finite set of possible moves, the team used deep learning to create a continuously-learning algorithm that improved over time; such learning provided human players with new insights into tactics and strategy as the algorithm used &lt;a href=&quot;https://deepmind.com/blog/innovations-alphago/&quot;&gt;unconventional and unintuitive moves&lt;/a&gt; during its play. Their later AlphaGo Zero algorithm, while not needing bootstrapping with even the rules of the game, or from records of previous games, benefitted from a novel approach to reinforcement learning in which it learnt outcomes from games it played against itself, generating data about outcomes in a feedback loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what about machine learning and healthcare?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM announced that they would build Watson for Health in 2013, launching services for cancer care that could recommend treatment regimens based on individual patient data and the latest research. During development, IBM acquired a number of companies possessing large amounts of health data, but within four years, the project had been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/607965/a-reality-check-for-ibms-ai-ambitions/&quot;&gt;shut down at the M.D. Cancer Centre, in Houston, USA&lt;/a&gt; and this year, it was reported that internal IBM reports documented &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2018/07/25/ibm-watson-recommended-unsafe-incorrect-treatments/&quot;&gt;that unsafe and incorrect cancer treatments were being recommended&lt;/a&gt;. In writing this blog post, I’ve found conflicting anecdotal reports of its success so it is difficult to conclude anything definitively at present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite such controversies, there have been some successes; Google DeepMind, in a collaboration with Moorfields Eye Hospital, have created an algorithm to interpret optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans, used to examine the structures of the retina in great detail, in order to &lt;a href=&quot;https://deepmind.com/documents/239/De%20Fauw%20et.%20al%20Nature%20Medicine%202018%20.pdf&quot;&gt;triage patients by identifying pathology requiring referral&lt;/a&gt;. In that paper, the authors compare performance of their algorithm with humans, identifying risks of over- and under-diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;advances in machine learning have created powerful, adaptive, learning algorithms that can outperform humans in niche areas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we need need labelled data, including outcome data, in order to teach an algorithm effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;performance of machine learning in healthcare has been subject to hype and relatively few proven success stories&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;progress in healthcare, so far, has been associated with taking decisions that have tightly defined scope and that are made in specific clinical contexts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;algorithms-in-healthcare&quot;&gt;Algorithms in healthcare&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Algorithms are already widely used in medicine, formally and informally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you have atrial fibrillation, we can use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chadsvasc.org/&quot;&gt;CHADS-VASC atrial fibrillation risk score calculator&lt;/a&gt; to estimate your risk of developing a stroke and therefore guide preventative treatment; should you be given anticoagulation, or not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How has such a scoring system been accepted and adopted in healthcare?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This score has been in development over many years, with multiple iterations. Initial calculators such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/193912&quot;&gt;CHADS2 being published back in 2001&lt;/a&gt; were created by pooling data from 1733 patients with a total of 2121 patient-years of follow-up and have subsequent been refined and validated in different cohorts of patients and adapted as a result of new advances such as the availability of novel anticoagulants that do not need close monitoring. An example of how iterative changes were made in this particular risk algorithm has been documented by &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehv431/10800295/ehv431.pdf&quot;&gt;Professor Lip from the University of Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;, emphasising the importance of ongoing validation and improvement with larger data sets and more representative population samples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of risk score can be generated by examining baseline characteristics and building a statistical model, such as Cox proportional hazards, to identify whether each characteristic has an effect on the outcome measure; such models also tell us the magnitude of that effect. Typically in conventional statistical methodology, the choice of which characteristics to examine is made by the investigators based on existing knowledge about the outcome in question; the approach is hypothesis-driven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use the magnitude of effect on outcome to generate a meaningful scoring system which can subsequently be validated as a prediction tool in a particular population. In essence, we predict an endpoint, in this case an outcome, with the presence or absence of characteristics, with information, known at the time of a decision in that population; validation in one population does not mean that an algorithm is appropriate in another. This prediction will itself be uncertain, with the model able to provide prediction of outcome with some degree of confidence; a 95% confidence interval means that we can be 95% certain that our prediction is within the range specified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adoption of clinical decision tools therefore result from rigorous process of academic work and &lt;em&gt;ongoing&lt;/em&gt; development and validation but is anything more needed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, adoption of clinical algorithms is also the consequence of a more informal set of processes and cultures that influence whether a tool gains sufficient traction within the wider community. Similarly, even if a tool is widely adopted, the use of the algorithm and any decision made as a result of that algorithm, in any individual clinical scenario, is usually at the discretion of the professional at the time; if it is used then it is used to attempt to reduce the uncertainty about a clinical decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we already use algorithms&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;algorithms become part of clinical practice after going through a set of formal and informal processes, with use dependent on culture, values and perceptions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ongoing monitoring and validation is required in order to safely apply an algorithm in a specific population.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;validation of algorithms is currently time-consuming and usually a once-off project, sometimes repeated at intervals. For example, in validating techniques to prevent stroke, there has been dedicated data collection of outcome data, such as whether the patient has had a stroke or not, usually as part of a registry study, because such data is not collected in a meaningful fashion in routine clinical practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;heuristics-in-healthcare&quot;&gt;Heuristics in healthcare&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also use a range of heuristics, sets of informal rules, in our day-to-day clinical work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started as a pre-registration house officer on the neurology ward in 1999, I quickly learned that patients with neuropathy almost certainly have a condition called chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), based on my “experience”. Almost every patient I saw with those symptoms had this condition, and my diagnostic sleuthing was calibrated based on this experience. I had quickly and unconsciously developed a heuristic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except I was wrong; my calibration was broken because patients with CIDP were the ones who were brought to the ward for their intravenous immunoglobulins and so they were the only patients with neuropathy I saw!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say that heuristics are not useful; indeed, heuristics are short-cuts that permit decision making at times of extreme uncertainty, frequently learnt by formal and informal teaching together with experience. For example, a heuristic might be used to take the right action if a life-threatening illness is simply a possibility, even if improbable. In many situations, we chain heuristics together, so that we don’t aim to make a diagnosis in a single cognitive step but instead using a chain of multiple, adaptive heuristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I might think you have migraine, but you are 65 years old and your headaches are waking you at night and I proceed to arrange a brain scan. From a purely Bayesian point-of-view, the probability of you having a brain tumour is low; this &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; probability is a consequence of dealing with rarer disorders. My use of &lt;em&gt;red flags&lt;/em&gt;, a set of heuristics that, we hope, prompt me to arrange an investigation to reduce the uncertainty in diagnosis in any individual patient, will result in lots of normal scans in the patients that I see. I accept a high rate of negative scans to increase my own sensitivity in identifying a patient with a serious underlying neurological disease; missing such a diagnosis has grave implications for the patient and I endeavour to calibrate my assessment to minimise the possibility, for that specific issue in that specific context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might think that heuristics used in clinical practice have been validated in the same way as any other decision aid, but frequently, there is very little data on the positive or negative predictive value of such tools. In addition, humans are subject to a range of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias&quot;&gt;cognitive biases&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0141033576/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1513438649&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=cognitive+biases&quot;&gt;“Thinking fast and slow” by Prof. Daniel Kahneman&lt;/a&gt;) which results in failures of our heuristics. For example, in confirmation bias, we may place greater emphasis on new information if it confirms a pre-existing belief or conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;humans use heuristics to help them make decisions, particularly at times of high uncertainty&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;humans are prone to a range of biases which result in mistaken decisions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we will benefit from understanding more about our own decision-making and improving the heuristics we use in daily clinical work; many of our own heuristics would benefit from further evaluation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;specific heuristics are useful, even if of low predictive value, if they increase sensitivity to identify life-threatening illness, in specific clinical contexts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;becoming-data-driven&quot;&gt;Becoming data-driven&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decision-making in healthcare, whether by human or machine, whether for making a decision or evaluating a prior decision, needs clinically meaningful &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kinds of health data do we have?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;data used for administration, e.g. hospital administrative data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;data for individual clinical care (traditionally paper based), e.g. medical records&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;data used for quality improvement and assessment of interventions in real-life environments, e.g. data acquired during specific clinical audit or service improvement projects&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;data used for for specific clinical research&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;data from the patient, either directly or via their own smart devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These data are usually separated in silos. It is uncommon for research studies to make use of real-life clinical data and similarly, research data is not usually made available for routine direct care purposes. Similarly, how can we evaluate quality-of-life data without understanding a patient’s long-term health conditions or surgical procedures?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, each type of data is, itself, highly fragmented. For example, data from one research project are held separately to those from another, and even data for direct clinical care usually collected and stored on a per-organisation basis, shared in only a limited fashion, if at all, between organisations providing care for a single patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problems are compounded by the fact that data relating to direct care is frequently paper-based. That’s why most hospitals cannot tell you how many patients with, for example, motor neurone disease , their teams look after or indeed their outcomes, without a project to specifically look at answering those questions for a set period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when healthcare professionals use electronic means of capturing information, such as electronic health record software, much of that information is not recorded in a way that makes it easily usable, neither by human nor machine, because it is unstructured or, at best, semi-structured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many users, those electronic health record systems are essentially monolithic so that user interface code, business logic and backend data storage is proprietary and must be integrated with other systems to achieve interoperability. When such systems need to be replaced, data must be migrated from the old to the new. We now recognise the benefits of separating data and its structure from the software code that operates upon that data; in healthcare, our data and its structure should be domain-driven given the complex, adaptive environment in which we work and our code can be stateless and often lightweight and ephemeral, particularly those components which are user-facing and most subject to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we need clinically meaningful data to be recorded and used to support a range of purposes, including: clinical decision making for the care of individual patients, managing our services, quality improvement and clinical research.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;as we capture clinically meaningful data during many different processes and for many different purposes, we must routinely aggregate information of different types, from different sources.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we need open data standards to build a complete holistic, aggregated &lt;em&gt;view&lt;/em&gt; of an individual patient or service; much information is not interpretable without understanding information from elsewhere or from different processes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we need semantic interoperability so that we can exchange and combine information from multiple sources.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we need to move away from procuring ‘full-stack’ applications that combine user interface code, business logic and data storage and move to lightweight, ephemeral user-facing applications each providing different perspectives on the same logical, structured healthcare record.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;as a result, we need to consider the benefit of an open platform, made up of open-source implementations of open standards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;evaluation-and-closed-feedback-loops&quot;&gt;Evaluation and closed feedback loops&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to consider multiple ways to evaluate our decisions, whether those decisions were made by human or machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For human students, we now use simulation at medical schools to help perform and learn in a safe, controlled environment; our human students are exposed to synthetic and real data in order to learn. In my role in assessments for the undergraduate medical course in Cardiff, I helped build a large multiple choice question bank so that we could implement continuous assessment, guiding learning through assessments and feedback on performance at multiple times during the academic year. Our human education has focused on creating a feedback loop in order to help learners improve. Contrived data are useful in testing that a clinician is &lt;em&gt;safe&lt;/em&gt;; we might issue a “yellow card” to a student missing a classic presentation of septicaemia in an examination and that student might fail, even if their overall score is in the pass range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In pharmaceutical drug development, sequential processes are used ranging from drug discovery, preclinical and clinical research, review and post-marketing surveillance. Each step examines the potential or actual efficacy of a drug; initially in models, then in control subjects, then in selected patients and then in real-life clinical environments. Each step makes use of different approaches and provides different insights into the performance of that drug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In clinical research, such as a &lt;em&gt;randomised controlled trial&lt;/em&gt;, we attempt to avoid biases; for example, if we only evaluate an intervention, such as a new drug, in real-life clinical practice, we would fail to control for clinicians inadvertently giving a new treatment only to a most healthy subset of patients. A controlled trial means that we control for spurious differences between a population that receives an intervention and a population that doesn’t, and ensure we remove as many biases as possible in our assessment of that intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of randomised controlled trials are usually considered highly generalisable to other populations; however we recognise that this is often not the case when trials exclude patients with, for example, multiple co-morbidities or have failed to recruit patients at the extremes of age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, changes in the way that we deliver care are difficult to evaluate as part of a randomised controlled trial; instead we might adopt an approach of &lt;em&gt;quality improvement&lt;/em&gt;. We use these type of methodologies when what we are studying is subject to considerable local variation such as differing local organisational structures; our learning may not necessarily be as generalisable as a randomised controlled trial.  Conversely this type of study may provide valuable information about how an intervention performs in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a range of quality improvement methodologies that act to iteratively define, measure, analyse, improve and control; a common feature of all is a cycle of measurement and intervention to examine and improve process and outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Healthcare, as yet, has failed to use technology to transform the way randomised trials and quality improvement are delivered. In modern technology companies, thousands of small randomised trials can be performed every day with closed feedback loops providing rapid assessment of outcome. For example, Google have embedded randomised trials into their software development pipeline, making it possible to run simple trials to assess the effect of changing, for example, font colour, on click-through rates by users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Routinely collected health data and randomised trials are dependent on a high-quality infrastructure which can collect clinically meaningful data and help to randomise, at any point of clinical equipoise, an individual into a trial of one intervention over another as well as streamlining the process of trial design and ethical approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;underpinning all approaches to evaluation is the collection and analysis of meaningful data, linking eventual outcome to the data known at the time of a decision; in essence, evaluation of any decision is predicated on a closed feedback loop.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;synthetic data is valuable in many circumstances, particularly for beginners.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;randomised controlled trials assess an intervention in a defined group, such as a specific cohort of patients and attempts to control for biases; they may be controlled with a placebo or the best current intervention. Modern trials are frequently complex, expensive and time-consuming and are difficult to run for any complex intervention and usually have very limited follow-up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;quality improvement approaches assess interventions in real-life contexts but are subject to inherent biases.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we currently lack a cohesive technical infrastructure that supports the definition, collection and analysis of meaningful, structured clinical data. Likewise, we lack tools to streamline and support the processes needed to undertake randomised trials in humans including design, ethical approval and the day-to-day identification, recruitment, consent and randomisation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;all clinicians will tell you that we face thousands of situations of clinical equipoise every day, a decision needs to be made in which one choice is no known to be better than another; we must endeavour to build an infrastructure that supports the systematic recruitment of patients into clinical trials as a matter of routine. We are seeing the start of this in oncology.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;such an infrastructure would support our current need for quality improvement and research, but also would support the use of systematic algorithmic decision support in clinical care to shape its development, its evaluation and ongoing post-marketing surveillance of safety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;and-so-what&quot;&gt;And so what?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I truly believe that software and data are of vital importance to the future of healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need, as professionals and as patients, to have the right information at the right time, in order for us to develop a shared understanding and make the right decisions in any given context. We use data to reduce the uncertainty about our decisions and we need the right tools to create and make sense of those data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning is an exciting and continuously-evolving field. I would argue that many of the changes we need to make in order to support the routine development, deployment, evaluation and monitoring of advanced algorithms in healthcare are the same ones that we need to use, right now, for our routine clinical practice. Whether our decisions are made by human or machine, or more likely a combination of both, whether those decisions are for an individual patient and for whole groups of our patients as part of developing our health services, understanding and assessing those decisions by the routine and systematic collection of meaningful data is vital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can start to understand what we need to do to achieve this by creating a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/wardleymaps&quot;&gt;Wardley map&lt;/a&gt;. We can start to build a map by thinking about a &lt;em&gt;value chain&lt;/em&gt;, in which we start with user need and try to understand the dependencies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ai-healthcare/ai-healthcare--part1.png&quot; alt=&quot;AI Healthcare value chain&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see that, to provide algorithmic decision support for patients and professionals, we need to consider&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;machine learning expertise&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;clinically meaningful data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;trust - by the public and professionals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have, for each of those, shown what I consider to be the dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can plot our value chain on a map, with the horizontal axis giving an indication as to whether that dependency is already available as a commodity, as a product to be bought or rented, as something we are developing or as something that is in its infancy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ai-healthcare/ai-healthcare--part2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ai Healthcare  Part2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, here we see that public and professional trust is dependent on professional and public engagement as well as an evaluation pipeline that creates a continuously monitored feedback loop driven by data. Their location on the map shows that we are only just starting to work on engaging the public on the use of data, while adopting randomised trials and quality improvement such as six sigma in healthcare is more mature but not yet a commodity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can add more information. Here, I’ve highlighted whether healthcare organisations or technology companies can provide one of the dependencies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ai-healthcare/ai-healthcare--part3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ai Healthcare  Part3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we see that machine learning expertise from technology companies must be combined with data expertise from healthcare organisations in order to successfully deliver algorithmic decision support in healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we can use our map to work out what we need to do in order to deliver the vision, incorporating an indication of evolution over time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ai-healthcare/ai-healthcare.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ai Healthcare&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can conclude from our map that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;clinically meaningful data is dependent on ongoing work to adopt open standards, and those standards are themselves dependent on an open-source toolchain that makes it easy to implement those open standards.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;aggregation of data from multiple sources is dependent on a scheme of data control and consent, so that citizens can opt-out and opt-in to share data for different purposes. This control and consent, I would argue, is also dependent on readily-available open source solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;continued professional and public engagement will result in an increasing recognition of the value of data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;semantic interoperability, itself dependent on open standards, will result in the creation of routinely aggregated interoperable health records&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;trust is dependent on engagement and building an evaluation pipeline supporting development, testing, deployment and real-life evaluation using a variety of processes, themselves supported by an enabling infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, if we want to revolutionise the use of technology in healthcare, we must become data-driven, and to do that, we need to create a suite of, likely open-source, tools that support the implementation of open standards, of consent and of quality improvement/research within day-to-day clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many healthcare organisations already use  master patient index  software in order to try to integrate multiple disparate applications but my suggestion is that we update this concept for the Internet-era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, we need to build a distributed and open system in order to provide resource location and authorisation services, driven by consent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Existing enterprise master patient indices (EMPIs) provide matching and linkage across systems within an enterprise.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We are already seeing a move to open platforms underpinned by modern information and technical standards.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We will need to federate data from multiple providers to create a consolidated health record for an individual citizen.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Such federation across platforms will require functionality to support resource location, so that the consolidated view includes information from any healthcare providers involved in that citizen’s care&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;That consolidated view may not need to contain personally-identifiable information for many purposes but even when de-identified or aggregated, it is possible to re-identity individuals. There is a identifiability continuum with re-identification risk proportionate to the number of different types of health and care data that form the consolidated view.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Citizens need appropriate tools and support in order to make their data sharing wishes clear and will need to be able to make their preferences clear for a range of different purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve this, I suggest that we need a &lt;em&gt;consent-driven distributed master patient index&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;1-the-enterprise-master-patient-index-empi&quot;&gt;1. The enterprise master patient index (EMPI)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An enterprise master patient index (EMPI) acts as a consistent up-to-date registry of patient information across multiple systems, allowing matching and linkage across those systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design of such a system derives from a historic use of individual healthcare applications that maintain their own patient indexes and need to be integrated with others. Those applications would usually store their own indexes in their own closed, proprietary backend storing the individual patient data against a local case record number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An EMPI acts to link these disparate applications by matching patient demographics and as a result, can  derive a list of identifiers for any given patient in any of the applications across an enterprise. EMPI products, such as IBM’s Initiate, generally use HL7 v2 messaging in order to provide lookup and matching services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;2-platforms-and-commoditisation&quot;&gt;2. Platforms and commoditisation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I truly believe that we are at the cusp of a revolution in healthcare information technology in which we will adopt Internet-era thinking and technology to support the transformation of healthcare. This transformation will permit a renewed focus on the needs of individual citizens and their caregivers, and how our services are designed to meet those needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest changes will be the spread of open platforms providing multiple components with standards-based application programming interfaces. Initially, these components will be part of a wider organisation-centric electronic health record system (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.cerner.com/&quot;&gt;https://code.cerner.com/&lt;/a&gt;), but, we will quickly see many components becoming commoditised and provided via cloud-based platforms (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/genomics/&quot;&gt;https://cloud.google.com/genomics/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scenario playing out is shown in this Wardley map:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mapping/maps-system-future-future-simple-map.png&quot; alt=&quot;Maps System Future Future Simple Map&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must recognise that several components of this architecture already have well-established solutions and are best bought or rented but that other components are, as yet, unknown and need more work in order to understand the best way to design, build and deploy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, we still have procured and installed locally software like radiology systems (Picture Archiving and Communication System - PACS) but even some of those could be provided as a service instead. For example, in Aneurin Bevan Health Board, they are using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drdoctor.co.uk/&quot;&gt;DrDoctor services&lt;/a&gt; for patient communication prior to outpatient clinic visits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel with this modularisation will be the move towards separating application code and logic from the data and its representations. As a result, we will have a new marketplace of new components will appear providing discrete computing services on-demand, making use of open data standards and readily available open-source tools to implement those standards. For example, could discrete computing functionality be provided to perform monitoring for acute kidney injury (AKI), currently using the state-of-the-art national AKI guidance? Similarly, could such an architecture permit the parallel testing and evaluation of &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; implementations of AKI detection before more widespread adoption?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, it is likely that the data and the application code (logic) will separate and themselves distributed as a &lt;em&gt;modular&lt;/em&gt; architecture founded on open standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;3-federation-and-caching&quot;&gt;3. Federation and caching&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federation is the process in which we can build a unified single view of data from across multiple distributed information systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a federation service might take a request for information about a patient, decompose that query across multiple source systems and return a unified composite view. Federation may combine the same or different types of data from multiple systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federation might simply directly pass on a query to multiple source systems at the time of the request; such an approach might be fine if each source system has predictably high levels of performance. Alternatively, it may instead implement a vendor-neutral archive updated from multiple source systems as they themselves are updated, providing a performant cache of information updated from source systems. Indeed, one might implement federation as a combination of both; in essence, federation provides a consolidated view across multiple systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;4-resource-location&quot;&gt;4. Resource location&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federation is dependent on appropriately locating resources for patients across a range of providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/01/apple-announces-effortless-solution-bringing-health-records-to-iPhone/&quot;&gt;built a federated health records service&lt;/a&gt; to iOS via the Health app and associated &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/health_and_fitness_samples/accessing_health_records&quot;&gt;application programming interfaces&lt;/a&gt;. This now provides a consolidated view of data from multiple healthcare providers in the United States, making use of the increasing available of data via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hl7.org/fhir/&quot;&gt;HL7 FHIR&lt;/a&gt;. To do this, health providers must specifically &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/healthcare/&quot;&gt;link with Apple&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google DeepMind built a &lt;a href=&quot;https://deepmind.com/applied/deepmind-health/working-partners/how-were-helping-today/&quot;&gt;federated records service&lt;/a&gt; to support their Streams app, providing a consolidated view of legacy data held within one organisation but across multiple sites and multiple software products. Those data populated, via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=185&quot;&gt;HL7 V2&lt;/a&gt;, are stored in a modern archive for performance reasons and made available via HL7 FHIR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both, I understand that resource location is centrally managed, requiring registration or bespoke integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any distributed system needs to be able to offer accurate and performant resource location, much as the domain name service (DNS) for the internet provides distributed conversion of user friendly domain names into numeric addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;5-privacy-and-identifiable-data&quot;&gt;5. Privacy and identifiable data&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many situations, such as providing direct-care such as an outpatient clinic, professionals benefit from being able to access identifiable up-to-date information. In other situations, such as when we are planning services to meet the needs of a population, it is sufficient to simply process de-identified information. Using the least identifiable information for any given given purpose is a core principle of sound data governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://understandingpatientdata.org.uk/sites/default/files/2017-07/Identifiability%20briefing%205%20April.pdf&quot;&gt;spectrum of identifiability&lt;/a&gt; with fully identifiable data at one extreme and aggregated statistics about a populations of patients at the other. With aggregate statistics, re-identification is much more difficult, but is possible when numbers of individuals with a set of characteristics are small. With de-identified patient-level data, re-identification is possible and becomes increasingly possible proportional to the quantity of linked data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you could not re-identify an individual if all you knew was that they were a &lt;em&gt;neurologist&lt;/em&gt;. If you knew they lived in &lt;em&gt;Wales&lt;/em&gt;, then you can narrow down the possibilities. A neurologist, from Wales interested in &lt;em&gt;information technology&lt;/em&gt;. You’ve re-identified me. Probably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way of trying to de-identify information is to simply replace all personally-identifiable information with a pseudonym, a random identifier. However, if all data on an individual is given the same identifier, the re-identification risk is higher than if only a single type of data is available. As such, we can augment de-identification by splitting data and giving each split a different identifier and permitting the creation of a dynamic consolidated view of data across multiple systems using multiple identifiers by virtue of a variable degree of linkage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Google Maps will track route journeys for traffic analysis, but reduces the privacy impact by splitting up the journey into smaller sections, each with a different identifier. Your progress during those sections is recorded to help others, but no-one is able to recombine those data to find out from where you travelled. Anonymisation occurs because there is no linkage from your identifiable information (your account details) and the traffic identifiers. If Google kept a record of your account and the identifiers used to track your journeys, then conceivably your journey could be recreated and your data has only be de-identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, it is possible to further limit the risk of re-identification by deliberately adding &lt;em&gt;noise&lt;/em&gt; into datasets so that aggregate statistical analyses give the same results as the original source data; such an approach is called &lt;em&gt;differential privacy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, we can work to protect privacy by both controlling the &lt;em&gt;linkage&lt;/em&gt; of data from different sources as well as deliberately adding &lt;em&gt;noise&lt;/em&gt; into data when aggregated and shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;6-consent-and-health-data&quot;&gt;6. Consent and health data&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health data have three broad purposes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;for direct care of an individual patient&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;for supporting and running services by aggregating individual-level data at the level of an organisation, service or cohort in order to monitor and improve services for those patients&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;for supporting research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are more detailed examples at &lt;a href=&quot;https://understandingpatientdata.org.uk/why&quot;&gt;https://understandingpatientdata.org.uk/why&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all health data are the same. For example, information relating to sexual health, termination of pregnancy, genetics, mental health, substance abuse, employment issues and stigmatising social data may, at the discretion of an individual, be considered quite differently from other health data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pharmaceutical companies and clinicians are interested in assessing the real-world outcomes of their treatments and projects like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.herc.ox.ac.uk/downloads/health_datasets/browse-data-sets/general-practice-research-database-gprd&quot;&gt;Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD)&lt;/a&gt; demonstrate the usefulness of this post-marketing surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consent may be opt-in or opt-out and given implicitly or explicitly. When you sign up to a clinical research project, you must opt-in. When you don’t want your health data shared for secondary uses in NHS England, you can opt-out. When you attend a hospital and extend your arm in order to let someone take your blood, you have given &lt;em&gt;implicit&lt;/em&gt; consent. When you sign a consent form for your appendicectomy, you give &lt;em&gt;explicit&lt;/em&gt; consent. When you attend hospital unconscious and we work to treat you, we are working in your &lt;em&gt;best interests&lt;/em&gt;. When your advance decision to refuse treatment (ADRT) states that you do not want cardiopulmonary resuscitation, to perform that act would be an act of assault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NHS England care.data project was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bmj.com/content/354/bmj.i3907&quot;&gt;halted in the face of widespread public criticism and loss of trust&lt;/a&gt;, despite the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bmj.com/content/354/bmj.i3852&quot;&gt;potential benefits&lt;/a&gt; for population health and clinical research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the outcomes of the debacle was a renewed focus on &lt;em&gt;building trust&lt;/em&gt; and obtaining &lt;em&gt;consent&lt;/em&gt;. As a result, we must work to ensure that we organise health information to make it accessible subject to &lt;em&gt;consent&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;control&lt;/em&gt; by the individual or their representative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;so-what-follows&quot;&gt;So what follows?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, I have argued that we need a distributed equivalent of a master patient index designed for the Internet-era and driven by consent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This index needs, itself, to be distributed and federated, and yet designed to protect privacy. My next blog post in this series touches on some of the potential technical standards and services required to support such a system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS My previous posts on &lt;a href=&quot;/information-governance/2017/04/08/pseudonymous-consent.html&quot;&gt;pseudonymous consent&lt;/a&gt; and associated code were an experiment solving some of the issues that I’ve finally got around to documenting here.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I would like to introduce the concept of a consent-driven distributed master patient index.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Healthcare information technology strategy</title><link href="https://www.wardle.org/strategy/2018/07/19/mapping.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Healthcare information technology strategy" /><published>2018-07-19T20:19:19+01:00</published><updated>2018-07-19T20:19:19+01:00</updated><id>https://www.wardle.org/strategy/2018/07/19/mapping</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.wardle.org/strategy/2018/07/19/mapping.html">&lt;p&gt;How can we make best use of technology to support healthcare?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we plan a coherent strategy that delivers, with pace, safety and reliability, solutions to the problems we face now while being adaptable enough to adapt to what is likely to come in the future?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to discuss &lt;em&gt;strategy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While written for NHS Wales, I hope this has a broader appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;1-we-need-information-technology-for-health-and-care&quot;&gt;1. We need information technology for health and care&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health and social care are complex adaptive environments made up of many interdependent parts. They are usually the responsibility of multiple different organisations but ideally, they should all work in a &lt;em&gt;coordinated&lt;/em&gt; way to support us all, the citizen in our health and care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I truly believe that software is critical to the future of healthcare, in supporting both patients and health professionals in their respective roles. Current software usually does little but replace existing paper processes but we should be aiming to use software to transform our health services.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;My blog post, May 2018 &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2018/05/06/clinical-software-quality.html&quot;&gt;The value of software for healthcare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information technology should be the foundation on which our health and care services run. We need to apply deep knowledge of the data, the systems and processes that are involved in those services in order to effectively design and build information technology services to underpin our efforts to support and improve health and social care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much of the routine and systematic processes of care, quality improvement and research could be enhanced by the appropriate use of technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many industries, digital &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the way that they now conduct their business. Digital technology offers scope to transform our services by making them safer, more efficient and better &lt;em&gt;learning systems&lt;/em&gt; by making our work &lt;em&gt;data-driven&lt;/em&gt;, whether for direct care of an individual patient, caring for groups of patients or working to research better ways of providing care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must stop thinking of information technology as a goal in itself and instead see it as a &lt;em&gt;tool&lt;/em&gt; to support our wider ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;2-we-need-a-cohesive-strategy&quot;&gt;2. We need a cohesive strategy&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Richard Rumelt, a strategy has three core parts that he calls the “kernel”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we must define the challenge&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we must have a guiding policy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we must have coherent action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decisions we make are about &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; to do, the broad principles as to &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to do them and then ruthlessly acting to &lt;em&gt;deliver&lt;/em&gt;, each action coordinated and building upon others iteratively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must delicately balance top-down centralisation and standardisation with bottom-up local need and innovation. As such, we must define a set of enduring broad guiding principles about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; we will solve problems, likely mandated or recommended across our enterprise while permitting adaptable coherent action at a more local level to solve local problems while not running counter to the overall direction. A guiding policy “directs and constrains action without fully defining its content.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to stubbornly defend and enforce our guiding policies but be flexible and adaptable on the actions that we take to meet our challenges. This is why my first action, as chair of the NHS Wales Technical Standards Board was to propose to our group that we adopt the GDS design principles; we agreed this in our June 2018 meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;3-components-and-modularisation&quot;&gt;3. Components and modularisation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must recognise that different parts of our enterprise are not all the same and so it helps to break up our problems into smaller problems which can be solved independently from the whole. Likewise, we can see that those components can change at different rates depending on user needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breaking up monolithic architectures and applications into components requires skill and experience but is an important part of improving reliability, testability and delivery across an enterprise. When components are tightly coupled then it becomes increasingly difficult to make changes, not only because changes have unpredictable side-effects but because teams need to constantly check with others in order to make progress. I have given a specific example in the footnotes.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#wcrs&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you break up our healthcare enterprise in Wales, we can see three broad categories of component:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;some have already well-established solutions and need to focus on operational efficiency, metrics and analytics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;some have to take what has been proven to work and improve and scale those solutions in order to deliver working products that are safe and reliable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;some have to take user need and experiment and explore the best way of solving those needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will recognise these three categories as Simon Wardley’s “Town planners”, “Settlers” and “Pioneers”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our healthcare information technology strategy must explicitly recognise &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt; and adaptability. One insight, from a healthcare perspective, is that different things change at different speeds and that, given the legal and regulatory aspects of our work in healthcare, data are the bedrock from which we can build. Those data should be structured and clinically meaningful. Conversely, we should regard the tools (applications) with which we interact with those data as much more ephemeral and driven by clinical and business workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A portal-centric approach has, in my opinion, created years of technical debt. We must work immediately to stop this approach and instead build an &lt;em&gt;open, standards-based platform&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;4-lets-map&quot;&gt;4. Let’s map&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;value-stream&lt;/em&gt; is a flow-chart helpful in illustrating, analysing and improving our &lt;em&gt;delivery&lt;/em&gt; of solutions to problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what we have in Wales:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mapping/maps-system-current-value-chain.png&quot; alt=&quot;Maps System Current Value Chain&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vertical axis gives a broad indication of &lt;em&gt;visibility&lt;/em&gt;, reflecting that users have needs and that they are supported by visible components of our architecture which themselves are supported by less visible pieces of infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks a bit complicated doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the top of the value chain, we have our users and some of their needs. The important points are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patients and caregivers are considered as well as professionals, reflecting our focus on the citizen and their interactions with health services. We should see digital as a way of transforming health services.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The list of user needs is incomplete but I hope illustrative and useful as-is.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are already items of user need from this limited list not met by the architecture as-is, particularly in relation to patients and their caregivers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trying to integrate multiple applications each with their own storage and structure of data is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; complicated and the complexity increases exponentially when we want to add new functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have omitted many important projects such as the Welsh Cancer system, CANISC.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I haven’t even included newer projects like e-Observations and flow, recording pulse, blood pressure etc. on mobile devices to identify the deteriorating patient - functionality of high benefit to patients and professionals.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I haven’t included the interoperability need with other enterprises, such as cross-border transfers of care with England (particularly important for North Wales and specialist services) or social care.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patients and caregivers have extremely limited functionality presently; they can use a product called “My Health Online” which has failed to gain traction and there is pilot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.patientsknowbest.com/&quot;&gt;PatientsKnowBest&lt;/a&gt; in Abertawe Bro Morgannwg. Renal patients can also see their own results via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patientview.org/#/&quot;&gt;PatientView&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the complexity seems inherent in healthcare, in which there has traditionally been a cycle of procurement of “systems” or “products” which must be integrated into the wider enterprise. Fortunately, we can make decisions now that can mitigate this complexity. We should always aim for simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have multiple local health boards, multiple patient administrative systems (PAS), most of which use the same product but are configured differently and do not support cross-PAS workflows, and multiple instances of a single “portal” (WCP) which are linked to the local PAS so show administrative data only from that health board. This means it is possible for me to login to WCP, a national product, in Cardiff and see that a patient is alive, and at the same time login to the same application in Cwm Taf and see that a patient has died. Similarly, as I sat in clinic yesterday, I could see a list of upcoming appointments for Cwm Taf only, and not for any other health board. We &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; have a single patient record but instead multiple instances of multiple applications giving different views of different data. In short, we have a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;5-evolution&quot;&gt;5. Evolution&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can help ourselves understand our architecture by adding an “evolution” dimension to our value chain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mapping/maps-system-current-map.png&quot; alt=&quot;Maps System Current Map&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The horizontal axis is a broad indication of the level of &lt;em&gt;evolution&lt;/em&gt; of a component. If you are unfamiliar with Wardley mapping, then I suggest you read &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/wardleymaps&quot;&gt;Simon Wardley’s mapping book&lt;/a&gt;. I am a novice at this - these are my first maps and would value your comments. Power is a commodity; it is fungible - it doesn’t matter &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; provides electricity. The laboratory information management software (LIMS) from Intersystems is a product, bought off-the-shelf and integrated with the wider enterprise via another off-the-shelf product, the enterprise service bus providing a messaging fabric. Custom-built software and components such as our data centres&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now see that we are using several off-the-shelf components - such as GP systems, emergency unit systems, laboratory systems etc. in conjunction with several custom-built applications and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefit of this type of map is that it helps us understand the options available to us. It also forces us to reconsider our architectural decisions and start to think about whether we have actually made the right decisions about the type of components we use. I think it is obvious from this map that focusing on products and projects is creating technical debt and making it more difficult to deliver solutions to end-users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, we see that we are building in-house some components that, with a basic knowledge of the commercial market, we could instead buy off-the-shelf. Can we justify, for example, running two data centres and building custom software that is already available elsewhere?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some in Wales who think that it is right to adopt a “portal” based approach, but this map clearly shows how that approach is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The map shows how professionals already use multiple software applications; we know the current  portal cannot replace that functionality in any timely fashion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The map shows the difficulties inherent in trying to integrate multiple applications without an underlying &lt;em&gt;single patient record&lt;/em&gt;. Many of the reliability and data inconsistency problems result from a lack of focus on that record&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There has been a historic focus on bespoke point-to-point integration with proprietary APIs that then become difficult to manage and impossible to change for fear of breaking another integration somewhere else.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We are spending time and resources on developing the things that others can do, and failing to build the things only Wales can build.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our portal is a single code-base providing user-facing functionality (user interface), business logic and tightly-coupled bespoke interfaces to services that are usually not made available to any other application. This fails to recognise that different components can be developed at different speeds with different methodologies.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Instead, we need to understand that different components are subject to different rules - so that components on the left of our diagram should be built in an agile-way, with rapid iterations and significant user engagement. Components to the right are commodities or components with well developed solutions that can be bought or rented. When a component can be provided as a commodity, we should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be developing it in-house without very good reason. Our architecture needs to reflect these differences. As such, it makes more sense to create a portal using components of a wider platform than a monolithic application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;adapting-to-change&quot;&gt;Adapting to change&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These maps also help us to understand how we are positioned to take advantage of new innovation and changing need. For example, we increasingly see adoption of cloud-computing, in which data centres become a commodity onto which computing power can be provided. We see an increasing marketplace of cloud-based functions, software code run on demand usually on a pay-as-you-go model, providing both core and specialist computing functionality such as data storage, speech-to-text and text-to-speech services, translation services etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I predict a marketplace of discrete computing services tailored for healthcare provision. Such services will make use of open industry standards to decouple code from the data on which they operate and offer increasingly valuable functionality such as clinical decision support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, patients and caregivers now expect to be able to interact with their health and care services by using technology. Part of digital inclusion is ensuring that multiple channels of interaction are possible, designed to suit different people. We see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/01/apple-announces-effortless-solution-bringing-health-records-to-iPhone/&quot;&gt;Apple rapidly bringing clinical data&lt;/a&gt; from multiple hospital sites in the United States to patient’s own devices via their Health app and the use of HL7 FHIR standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we can see that we will be wanting to evaluate and make use of machine learning within our healthcare systems very soon. We need to build systems that permit the safe deployment and evaluation of such systems and a much of that work will involve plumbing together data pipelines safely and securely, subject to patient consent and an option to opt-out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we add all of these to our map?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mapping/maps-system-future-broken-map.png&quot; alt=&quot;Maps System Future Broken Map&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the architecture lacks a cohesive design requiring multiple bespoke end-to-end integrations between systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;think-of-functional-services-not-products&quot;&gt;Think of functional services not products&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should instead be thinking of discrete, functional logical services which can be built and run independently or semi-independently that, together form part a &lt;em&gt;platform&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our core design principles is to &lt;em&gt;do the hard work to make things easy&lt;/em&gt;. This means rethinking our map. It is still complicated, but our user-facing applications like mobile applications and a modern rewritten portal can be developed in an agile way while using platform components that are either a built in-house,  bought or rented or, over time, a commodity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, we don’t expect client applications to understand the nuances of our local enterprise architecture, but instead provide a managed API gateway, offering simplifying access to a &lt;em&gt;logical single patient record&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mapping/maps-system-future-logical-map.png&quot; alt=&quot;Maps System Future Logical Map&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, one can see that many of these components will increasingly become a commodity. I’ve shown this with the “data repositories” component, which spans the “product” and “commodity” evolutionary sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;6-delivery&quot;&gt;6. Delivery&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work informs our work on the technical standards we need to prioritise in order to deliver a modern, open, standards-based platform for Wales providing a single patient record for use by a &lt;em&gt;variety&lt;/em&gt; of user-facing applications. Such applications may be a commodity or custom-built but are ephemeral and lightweight, with business logic delegated to the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, we need to reconfigure the way we work in Wales and create:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an applications group who have responsibility for delivering lightweight applications to solve user need. These teams should work in an agile-fashion and share code and frameworks, releasing their work as open-source, building libraries and components that, together with the open platform, provide a toolbox of functionality for building the next generation of healthcare applications.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a platforms group made up of teams, each of which are responsible for developing, testing and deploying modular components of the wider platform according to our mandated technical standards and design principles. These teams should deliver components which are continuous deployed into multiple production-like test environments allowing automated testing of both operation and performance. Similarly, commodity computing power, such as that provided by commodity cloud providers like Amazon, Google and Microsoft, should be available on-demand with infrastructure-as-code, allowing teams to easily build, test and deploy without recourse to external teams. These principles underpin the “DevOps” movement.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an architectural standards and strategy board, including both technical and information standards boards for operational and analytics use and defining the top-down broad principles for use across NHS Wales and its partners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Welsh digital ecosystem project is critically dependent on an open platform. We can build that  open platform using a lot of the good work already done in Wales. We have a terrific opportunity to create a health and care enterprise fit for the 21st Century for the citizens of Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what might our map look like in the future? Here the platform and its components are evolving to become a commodity, but we can see that our work will be in developing the best user-facing components, focused on solving workflow and user need while taking advantage of new advances in machine learning, artificial intelligence and decision support. Who thinks we’ll be running our own data centres then?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mapping/maps-system-future-future-simple-map.png&quot; alt=&quot;Maps System Future Future Simple Map&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;acronyms--descriptions&quot;&gt;Acronyms / descriptions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;API - application programming interface&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ESB - enterprise service bus. Messaging fabric carrying HL7 v2 messages between producers and listeners. Should allow decoupled development but caveat emptor! Continue to use for some uses but move to an API-based approach for most modern applications.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ESR - electronic staff record&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;NIIAS - “National Intelligent Integrated Audit Service” - currently used at the application-level. Needs to be embedded at the API-layer (platform) instead&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OAUTH2 - authentication framework&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PAS - patient administration systems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;WCP - Welsh Clinical Portal - a currently monolithic application providing a portal, one instance per health board coupled to the local PAS.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;WCRS - Welsh Care Records Service - a document repository and search service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;Footnotes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;wcrs&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;: Modularisation of architecture is important for reliability and pace of delivery. When components are loosely-coupled, the interactions between them are limited and it becomes possible to develop them independently, in parallel. A team can completely change the underlying implementation or even whether the service runs on-premises or in the cloud. Conversely, a tightly-coupled architecture makes change difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example in Wales is a service like the Welsh Care Records Service (WCRS) which provides a non-standard application programming interface to store and retrieve documents and the application Welsh Clinical Portal (WCP) uses that API, together with an associated instance of Apache Solr in order to provide search. In essence, these are tightly coupled because if the team working on WCRS wish to change the way the Solr index is built, they must link very closely with those building the user-facing application, WCP. It also means other parties cannot, independently, make use of WCRS to implement functionality in their systems at the application programming interface (API)-level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mapping/wcrs-architecture.png&quot; alt=&quot;Wcrs Architecture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is shown in this schematic, where “external” services such as document repositories in the health boards publish documents into WCRS but the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; way to view and search documents is via a portal application, WCP.  There are less than a handful of releases of WCP per year. Is it any wonder that users across Wales are dissatisfied with the pace of change?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">How can we make best use of technology to support healthcare?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Cancer informatics</title><link href="https://www.wardle.org/platform/2018/07/03/cancer-informatics.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Cancer informatics" /><published>2018-07-03T17:16:16+01:00</published><updated>2018-07-03T17:16:16+01:00</updated><id>https://www.wardle.org/platform/2018/07/03/cancer-informatics</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.wardle.org/platform/2018/07/03/cancer-informatics.html">&lt;p&gt;The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of the National Assembly for Wales heard evidence yesterday from Velindre NHS Trust on cancer informatics. You can see more &lt;a href=&quot;http://senedd.assembly.wales/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=441&amp;amp;MId=4751&amp;amp;Ver=4&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; including the video. The minutes will appear soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important messages were&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CANISC, the Cancer Network Information System Cymru, has been running for over 20 years and is dependent on a now unsupported software platform. This has important security and reliability risks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There have been a significant number of reliability issues resulting in service disruption and impact on patient care. There was no single reason for the multiple system failures.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;That there are mitigations planned so that a PDF of the important information will be published into the Welsh Care Records Service and so be visible via Welsh Clinical Portal (WCP). WCP is currently mainly a read-only web portal but also has electronic test requesting and discharge summary functions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;That a replacement is planned using two products: adoption of “Welsh PAS” a homegrown patient administrative system that is deployed in most other health organisations in Wales for administration, and WCP to be modified to create an electronic patient record system. This work is estimated to take 2 years.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#migration-pd&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to reflect on these issues in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;our-role-as-informaticians&quot;&gt;Our role as informaticians&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of definitions of what we do in clinical informatics, but this is a good one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The overall aim of work in Clinical Informatics is to use modern technologies to advance our ability understand health and health problems, support translational research, develop effective interventions for healthcare delivery, and improve our ability to provide cutting-edge healthcare in the safest, most timely way possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.clinicalinformatics.group.cam.ac.uk/about-us/introduction-to-clinical-informatics/&quot;&gt;http://www.clinicalinformatics.group.cam.ac.uk/about-us/introduction-to-clinical-informatics/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;accessed on 3rd July 2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, in order to be an effective clinical informatician, we need to deeply understand the problems we are trying to solve while at the same time applying our knowledge of best practices in information technology. We need to be cognisant on how teams can work effectively at scale and pace with a focus on delivery. Likewise, we need to bring together our understanding of user need with the very best in software development practices, understand the wider context and foster the adoption of technical and information standards to support semantic interoperability and use the principles outlined in domain-driven design to build data models and a shared vocabulary to bridge the gaps between users and developers. At the same time, we need to apply evidence-based best practice in development, testing, safety, security and deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-crisis-always-an-opportunity-to-reflect&quot;&gt;A crisis: always an opportunity to reflect&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A crisis is usually a good time to step back and take stock of our current state, to appraise ourselves of the options and really understand the problems we are trying to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s useful to structure our approach to how we understand need along the lines of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gov.wales/docs/dhss/publications/151211reporten.pdf&quot;&gt;Informed Health and Care Strategy, 2015&lt;/a&gt; which sets out a clear vision for Wales to use digital technology and online services to support and enable care. The strategy is divided into four workstreams:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Information for you&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supporting Professionals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improvement and Innovation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A Planned Future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/digitalhealthconf/wardle-digital-health.003.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Informed Health and Care&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kinds of requirements might arise from a deep-dive with our users? What kind of functionality do they need, noting that our “users” are not only professionals, but the citizen or their delegated representative?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not hard to start brainstorming and that’s a critical first step in solving our problems. So we might end up with a list that looks a bit like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patients:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patients to see their whole journey including forthcoming scheduled appointments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patients to be able to communicate securely with their healthcare team, at whichever point of the pathway they currently sit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patients to be given tools to help them understand their condition, their prognosis and treatment options, perhaps with outcome data stratified according to their characteristics.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patients to see their own results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professionals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Professionals to understand how many patients sit at each stage of the pathway and track progress and ongoing outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Professionals to have access to the right information at the right time. This means diagnostics from anywhere, including outside of Wales, as well as multidisciplinary meetings, histopathology, staging, previous treatments and interventions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Professionals to be able to communicate as a team, and have those interactions recorded as a narrative, irrespective of their organisation, specialty or profession.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Professionals to be given tools to aid shared decision-making, understanding outcomes for an individual patient compared to peers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improvement and Innovation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To support quality improvement methodologies by tracking measures of process &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; outcome using meaningful measures&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To support the advancement of knowledge by offering support for identification, recruitment and randomisation into potentially complex, multi-phase clinical trials of new treatments.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To capture aggregate data stratified by baseline characteristics to permit benchmarking.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To ensure digital inclusion with multiple channels so that patients have choice and multiple opportunities to contribute information in methods of their choosing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To permit innovative models of care, capture outcomes relating to those innovations and ensure that they are fit-for-purpose and not exclusionary to any group of individuals based on access to technology, age, socioeconomic class etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience however, users, whether professionals or patients, need help in understanding and articulating their need and once we’ve done that, we can frequently boil down requirements into their &lt;em&gt;essence&lt;/em&gt;. I love being able to solve a specific requirement by solving it in a generic way that helps not only that individual, but everyone else as well. Generic solutions are usually more robust and future-proof compared to solutions that simply solve a specific problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most generic problem-solving techniques is to become &lt;em&gt;data-driven&lt;/em&gt;. Almost every single post on my blog relates to this fundamental approach in which one thinks deeply about data, the structure of those data and how best to make use of those data in order to inform our clinical practice, whether at an individual patient level, at the service level, at a cohort level or by helping to advance our knowledge as part of research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I have just jotted those few down over 10 minutes. We need to sit down with colleagues across Wales and empower them to think big with data. My belief is that, when one sees a list of requirements as I have written above, the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; way to deliver that type of functionality is to &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/08/22/health-data.html&quot;&gt;start with data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, I believe that most of the requirements relating to cancer and cancer pathways are just as important to other non-cancer specialities. We must stop thinking about projects and products, and start thinking about &lt;em&gt;services&lt;/em&gt; and the data the underpin those services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;on-data&quot;&gt;On data&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Larry Weed opined:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“You’re a victim of it or a triumph because of it. The human mind simply cannot carry all the information without error so the record becomes part of your practice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here he makes the critical point that the medical record is the foundation on which our clinical practice occurs and understanding this is critical for those of us interested in improving healthcare by the use of information technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I strongly believe that healthcare data should be stored in a persistent record as a model of the real-world and its storage should be &lt;em&gt;separate&lt;/em&gt; from the applications and logic which act upon it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This simple separation is a terrifically powerful paradigm because it means that others can use those data in ways that I might not even imagine at this point in time. What it means is that I have to think clearly, not about how an application might look or work, but how my data is structured to be meaningful, both now and in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I wrote in my &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/03/15/once-for-wales.html&quot;&gt;“Once for Wales” speech&lt;/a&gt; in which I pitched for interoperability and data standards for NHS Wales:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is almost always the case that when building complex solutions to real-life problems, no-one person can conceive of all of the problems in one go. The natural solution to such complexity is to break-down a problem into manageable chunks. These chunks, much like “lego bricks”, can be joined together to form something greater than the sum of the parts. Importantly, it is more likely that we can vouch that a system is deterministic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, I believe that we need to move away from products, from projects and towards modular &lt;em&gt;services&lt;/em&gt;, that together create an open platform. I have written extensively about this in my blog including the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wardle.org/clinical-informatics/2017/10/19/data-driven.html&quot;&gt;talk I gave at the inaugural Welsh Digital Health and Care Conference in 2017.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;on-services&quot;&gt;On services&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I say we should focus on “services”, I mean two different things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I think about computing &lt;em&gt;services&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a proponent of a data-driven open platform, built from open standards and with a focus on providing a common set of modular, loosely-coupled computing services supporting citizen and professional identity, data and document repositories and other clinical information like laboratory, radiology and other investigation results. These services, abstracting complexity and possibly federating data from multiple providers,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#federation&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, should be focused on building sane, cohesive application programming interfaces (API) suitable for both internal and external developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I think about healthcare &lt;em&gt;services&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe in digital transformation, in the use of technology to improve and transform our services. This cannot be led by an information technology department, or for that matter, an external agency acting independently from health services, but instead must be led and &lt;em&gt;owned&lt;/em&gt; by the service. There is, of course, need for expert digital teams to help &lt;em&gt;support&lt;/em&gt; those transformation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-future-welsh-pas-and-wcp&quot;&gt;The future: “Welsh PAS” and WCP?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I come to the crux of the problem. We are told that the combination of “Welsh PAS” and WCP will solve my cancer colleagues’ problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current crisis with CANISC was foreseeable and clearly we, in Wales, must take action. I have one question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Where can I find an analysis of the different options available in order to fix this mess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surely we need to step back and cost and appraise a range of options, bringing together the advantages and disadvantages of any specific option in order to weight up and decide on the right choice. Given that this decision appears to be made by an organisation who is also acting as the supplier of said software seems to me, an important conflict of interest. To mitigate that, such decision-making should be published openly and transparently with the justifications and arguments in favour of this important decision for our cancer services. If these options analyses exist, then they should be published as with any other “procurement”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly I can make some comments about the proposed solution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welsh PAS is actually a misnomer as actually there are multiple instances of the software package running, all configured differently to different standards and Cardiff and Vale uses its own in-house administrative system. At the time of writing, as far as I know, there is no easy way of tracking a pathway between health boards, meaning that a patient starting their cancer journey in one health board and managed in another will not share the same national pathway identifier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WCP mainly stores documents as blobs of data with a proprietary and very limited metadata model. Some documents are in XML format and are rendered to PDF on-the-fly during viewing. If we view a document in a different health board, at the time of writing, it currently renders using the wrong stylesheet and so it appears as if was written by our own health board. Data within documents can be accessed by parsing the data from the XML, but there is currently &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; data persistence layer; indeed there is no single instance of WCP, so users have to login to their local, organisation-specific instance of WCP which is currently tightly integrated with whatever patient administrative system is running in that organisation. That means that a patient can appear alive in one instance of WCP but is shown as dead in another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eForms project is meant to flexibly add data collection forms into WCP but at the time of writing, the lung cancer ETTF project has stalled and the diabetes project delayed. Change requests to electronic test requesting have been parked for many months in preparation for a new eForm based solution which has not yet been deployed. I am not aware that any decision has been made as to &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; data recorded in an eForm is actually persisted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it difficult to understand how these solutions will solve even the simple requirements I’ve listed above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am therefore concerned that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have not fully understood the wider requirements underpinning a modern cancer information system, to solve our current and future problems. It is likely that, fundamentally, the requirements of cancer services are likely to be more widely applicable to a range of specialties and services.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have not adequately performed a open transparent appraisal of the options in relation to cancer informatics.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;That the combination of Welsh PAS and WCP must be regarded as a significant &lt;em&gt;risk&lt;/em&gt; both in terms of delivery to the timescales and functionality, given the gaps between what is currently possible in “Welsh PAS” in WCP at the current time and what will be needed to support improvement and transformation in cancer informatics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I would argue that we should be focusing our efforts on building a generic open standards-based healthcare platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;migration-pd&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;: Few people are aware, but a few years ago, I migrated both Cardiff and Vale and Bridgend Parkinson’s services from CANISC to a new electronic patient record system, complete with demographics, diagnostic information, all encounters, clinic annotations and measurement data as well as drugs used past and present. Oh, and mapped all diagnoses and medications to SNOMED-CT at the same time. I did this over a few weekends and did the big migration over a single weekend. It was a hobby project but based on the fact that CANISC was end-of-life and we needed to do something. The database schema was a bit odd, but it wasn’t actually particularly difficult. We now track diagnoses and outcomes on a modern web-based platform across Wales that I built in my spare time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;federation&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;: Federation means encapsulating or abstracted multiple services under one, simple to use service. You might, for example, track professional identity by delegating authentication to social care or health care authentication services, and federate based on a namespace.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of the National Assembly for Wales heard evidence yesterday from Velindre NHS Trust on cancer informatics.
