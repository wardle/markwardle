&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I have previously discussed the value of information technology in supporting clinical care, unashamedly stealing and modifying Google’s original mantra:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“to organise the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and adapting it to healthcare information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/03/09/google-information.html&quot;&gt;to organise healthcare information and make it universally accessible and useful&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and argued that we should be making healthcare safer by &lt;a href=&quot;/information-governance/2017/03/19/information-governance.html&quot;&gt;running it on rails&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to talk about artificial intelligence and healthcare in relation to measurement, data and decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;decision-making&quot;&gt;Decision making&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is information important? At its most fundamental, healthcare is about decision making. As such, I would argue that making the right information available at the right time is critical in reducing the uncertainty around any decision in healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.howtomeasureanything.com&quot;&gt;“How to measure anything” by Douglas Hubbard&lt;/a&gt;. It is not primarily written for healthcare, but instead how to use measurement to reduce the uncertainty around business decisions with a particular emphasis on the importance of &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; is measured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decision-making in healthcare may be relating to the diagnosis or treatment of an individual patient but just as importantly relates to decision-making for groups of patients when we design our healthcare services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Douglas Hubbard:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In business cases, most of the variables have an “information value” at or near zero. But usually at least some variables have an information value that is so high that some deliberate measurement effort is easily justified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In medicine, many of our “measurements” (facts gleaned about how a symptom developed, results of investigations) have very high “information values”. Others have very little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I have regularly argued that we should be routinely recording structured information about our patients including information relating to problems, diagnoses and outcomes. Such data then allows us to make appropriate inferences about our patients such as, how is this patient doing compared to other patients with this condition? In many clinical situations, identifying the patient not behaving as expected is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, many of our current “measurements” in healthcare relate to information easily acquired, rather than measurements of &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt;. Before deciding on measurement, he opines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;What is the decision this measurement is supposed to support?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;What is the definition of the thing being measured in terms of observable consequences?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;How, exactly, does this thing matter to the decision being asked?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;How much do you know about it now (i.e., what is your current level of uncertainty)?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;What is the value of additional information?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are recording information (making measurements) that do not support decision making and that information has no intrinsic worth itself, then why are we asking/examining/performing/assaying/recording it at all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;reducing-uncertainty&quot;&gt;Reducing uncertainty&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if we decide that a measurement is worth doing, do we need to perform that measurement on all patients in order to make appropriate conclusions? The answer of course is no. We saw this in the recent UK general election in which an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/firth/exit-poll-explainer/&quot;&gt;exit poll&lt;/a&gt; correctly predicted the outcome based on sampling a small number of voters (100-200) at each polling station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, decision-making relating to groups of patients, particularly in relation to how we configure services or apply limited resources to populations of patients, does not need measurement of all people within those populations in order to reduce the uncertainty relating to those decisions. Instead, it is reasonable to perform those measurements on a random sample. A random sample is, however, not a sample based on a subgroup of patients who have volunteered to take part. Such a sampling methodology will introduce bias in your results. Instead, sampling should, ideally, be a random sample of individuals&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now these three propositions are outlined in the book (I have reworded them slightly to suit medicine):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We care about measurements because measurements inform uncertain decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For any decision or set of decisions, there are a large combination of things to measure and ways to measure them—but perfect certainty is rarely a realistic option.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Therefore, we need a method to analyse options for reducing uncertainty about decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;using-ai-to-reduce-uncertainty&quot;&gt;Using AI to reduce uncertainty&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In healthcare, we have a problem with information overload. I must manually scroll through laboratory results looking for something relevant, and in the current (nationally-provided) software I have to use, one has to actually click to open each individual result to check what it showed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we can refine our needs to include the importance of displaying the &lt;em&gt;right information at the right time&lt;/em&gt;. In other words, which “measurements” to show at a given time point that will most reduce the uncertainty relating to a decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While machine learning holds the promise for creating tools that can make clinical decisions inferences independently or semi-independently, I would argue that information technology should focus on valuably supporting care by organising and presenting information about patients to patients and clinicians and providing intuitive adaptive tools that allow the systematic recording of clinical information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is considerable hype relating to AI in healthcare, but this risks overlooking concrete and tangible benefits in the short-term to &lt;em&gt;augment&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;support&lt;/em&gt; humans, whether patient or clinician, in healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such goals may sound mundane compared to the future possibilities of machine learning in healthcare, but to clinicians and patients who have spent many years being “information-poor”, the power of having all relevant information available on hand as well as adaptive tools to record that information quickly and efficiently should not be under-estimated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a patient admitted with weakness as an emergency. An acetyl-choline receptor antibody test was requested by the general practitioner four weeks ago before the patient deteriorated quickly. Do you think the admitting team will notice that result sitting in the laboratory? At the moment, it will be left to luck. How can that be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, adaptive, learning, intelligent systems should be able to curate medical information (our “measurements”) in order to reduce uncertainty (in this case, our diagnosis of myasthenia gravis).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could try to manually curate the rules behind adaptive information displays with complex if…then statements, but ML offers scope to learn from clinicians. For example, real-time adaptive systems could learn what clinicians click on in different circumstances, “see” that patients are having repeated blood tests after a surgical procedure and then subsequently “understand” that it is useful to graph them. Like Amazon can suggest other things for you to buy, adaptive displays of information can “learn” to present the right information at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you have multiple sclerosis? Here are your outcomes over time compared to patients like you of the same age:
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/edss-graph.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Edss Graph&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have built that manually, but why can’t machines curate the information for us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;bayesian-logic&quot;&gt;Bayesian logic&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Healthcare professionals regularly use tacit rules to arrive at clinical decisions based on a set heuristics which will include ‘a priori’ knowledge applied to individual patients. For example, if I know Wilson’s disease is rare but treatable, I will attempt to diagnose it more frequently that something rare but untreatable. Likewise, if a condition is common, then I will test for it more frequently. Likewise, no investigation or diagnostic test is foolproof, with false positive and false negative results. &lt;em&gt;Bayesian inference&lt;/em&gt; is a way of adjusting the probability of a hypothesis (eg. my patient has Wilson’s disease) based on a combination of `a priori’ knowledge (e.g. its prevalence) combined with new information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in clinical practice it is difficult to truly understand the significance of new information. Just as we need to make information available, we also need help in deciding whether new information (“measurements”) are relevant to the clinical decision we face. As a result, we need technology to identify ‘a priori’ knowledge and support us in interpreting how new data influences our clinical decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion therefore, AI can valuably support healthcare by making the right information available at the right time, and learning how to present that information in the appropriate way to reduce the uncertainty relating to clinical decisions. In addition, adaptive systems can usefully identify the “measurements” (data) required to further reduce uncertainty, leveraging ‘a priori’ knowledge and appropriately adjusting to an individual scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, we need clinical information systems that enable health professionals and patients to make inferences and support clinical decision making, and AI can and must play a useful role in supporting those systems.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Paper is one of the most hazardous substances in a hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Keeping paper over EHR is like keeping horse and cart for fear of theft of cars.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Software is eating the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two are informal quips from colleagues on Twitter, but as I am going to argue that they are wrong, they shall remain nameless!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of you will recognise the last quote from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460&quot;&gt;Marc Andreeson&lt;/a&gt;. I truly believe that software is critical to the future of healthcare, in supporting both patients and health professionals in their respective roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a professional, I want information systems that support me in my work and facilitate changes in working practices that mean that I can do &lt;em&gt;my job&lt;/em&gt; more effectively and to the greater benefit of my patients. If I have electronic records wherever I am, I can have a consultation at any time, perhaps in person but perhaps not. With paper records, such responsiveness is not possible; who is going to fetch the notes from the archives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a patient, I want information systems that support me and facilitate changes in working practices that mean that I can do &lt;em&gt;my job&lt;/em&gt; more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;paper-isnt-all-bad-it-has-workflow-built-in&quot;&gt;Paper isn’t all bad… it has workflow built-in&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Dear Doctors, Can we stop printing out the electronic discharge summaries from the neurology day unit now that they are available in &lt;em&gt;Welsh Clinical Portal&lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“No. Please keep sending them, as otherwise we won’t know when the patient has been admitted and has had their investigations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very easy to design clinical information systems thinking about how the system will look and work and build a product that will solve the &lt;em&gt;perceived&lt;/em&gt; problem. I have written before about how we need to be careful on &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-design/2017/03/23/scope-framing-clinical-design.html&quot;&gt;framing our problem and scoping the solution to that problem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many hospitals now generate discharge documents electronically. They solve a problem: namely transcribing medications and then creating a discharge document. When a patient is discharged from hospital, a communication should be sent to ensure that the patient’s general practitioner is aware of the admission and what happened. Just like a referral to hospital, it is a handover of care from one team to another made up of a diagnostic synthesis and chain of reasoning supporting those diagnoses including results of relevant investigations together with any procedures or interventions and their complications. We used to hand-write these and then the fourth (illegible) copy would be sent to the general practitioner. Later, and sometimes months later, a team member might dictate a more formal summary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my colleague above, in asking for the electronic notifications to be printed, has identified a missing need that the new electronic discharge system fails to solve: a notification to support his workflow in his ongoing care of the patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;digitisation&quot;&gt;Digitisation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paper is not the most hazardous substance in the hospital; it is a key enabler of many processes and workflows with its use and subsequent benefits not necessarily explicitly understood by outsiders. A benefit of paper is that it allows end-users to rapid prototype a system that support a business workflow when an alternative is either not provided or impedes productivity. In essence, workflows built upon paper were the original “feral” systems until such time that they were replaced with a more formal system or became that system by virtue of its ongoing use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all have these “systems”. My secretary places notes in my in-tray and I process them. It is a workflow, albeit a rudimentary one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pile-of-notes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pile Of Notes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that these “feral systems” may not be acknowledged explicitly during information technology deployments - the workflow may be understood by all who work there but never explicitly expressed - it is tacit knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;software-should-be-eating-healthcare&quot;&gt;Software &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be “eating healthcare”&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have previously written about the &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/03/09/google-information.html&quot;&gt;importance of software in healthcare&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital transformation is more than simply replacing a single paper-based process with an electronic one. Instead, one needs to understand the workflows and processes that are dependent on the process you are examining and ensure that these are included in your design for a clinical information system:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start with data and the structures that will be used to hold that data. Data, particularly in health, will be immutable as it reflects what was done at that timepoint and changes in data should be modelled accordingly. Prefer open standards, adopt published information models and bind appropriate terminologies and data dictionaries so that you can provide semantic interoperability with partner software.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Examine the workflow and processes that are dependent and create explicit process models; there may be many such processes for different services with different perspectives on the same data. Different professionals need different views of the same data. Consider how such models can be flexibly configured at runtime using rule-based engines written in the language of the business, rather than hard-coding processes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Acknowledge that, at its most fundamental, healthcare is about communication. Software that ignores human factors will be doomed in the pit of &lt;a href=&quot;/cis-design/2017/05/02/clinical-modelling.html&quot;&gt;real-life/model mismatch.&lt;/a&gt; Build systems that improve communication between and among the healthcare team. Create shared records but understand there is a difference between notifications and alerts and reading a medical record.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the design of user-interfaces as a useful part of an exploratory process to understand data and workflow, but build a layered architecture with separation of data persistence, business/application logic and user interface. Consider user-facing applications to be minimal, thin-wrappers around more substantial services forming a “platform”, providing different perspectives for different users of the same data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plan user-facing applications for multiple devices, even if you don’t intend to create different versions now so that no-one inadvertently loses separation between business logic and the user interface. Make user interfaces “smart” in the way that they help the user but “stupid” in that they delegate their logic to underlying business services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Today’s conference reinforced my previously held beliefs about the best strategy for healthcare information technology improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the conference, we had a mixture of health professionals and academics, all struggling to do what they need to do. The nursing and care coordinators desperately need tools to support their day-to-day work, managing patients and recording their interactions and communicating with one another. The Motor Neurone Disease Association (MNDA)  want them to use Excel spreadsheets to audit their services for benchmarking and assessment against the NICE guidance. The researchers in the room want a population-based registry in which patient data are recorded to support national history modelling, epidemiological students and subsequently act as a platform for subsequent interventional studies. We heard about researchers collecting patient reported data using paper and pen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pattern recurs again and again and I’ve referenced the three core needs of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;supporting day-to-day clinical care,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;audit and quality improvement and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in my blog posts repeatedly: (eg see my post on &lt;a href=&quot;http://wardle.org/clinical-informatics/2017/06/06/using-data-patient-safety.html&quot;&gt;patient safety&lt;/a&gt;). This approach is not specific to motor neurone disease and is widely applicable. The critical issue is to embed the three processes within the same system so that, for example, a clinician recording research-level detailed phenotypic information about a patient for their area of interest uses the same system as the one that he or she uses to simply record a register of diagnoses. I think of a nested approach in one has small numbers of very well phenotyped patients and large numbers of less well phenotyped patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pyramid-of-data.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pyramid Of Data&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important component of this approach is increasing patient involvement in research. Patients want it but there are impediments such as the time needed to obtain patient consent and the resources needed to perform more detailed clinical evaluations. As such, using technology to support enrolment into clinical research is vital; that is, we must provide tools to obtain consent from large numbers of patients in a way that satisfies the regulatory frameworks in which we work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we are increasingly using patient-reported outcomes and adaptive questionnaires to not only understand how our patients fare but even to shape subsequent clinical consultations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it becomes straightforward to imagine an architecture that will support these needs. Indeed, if built correctly with a generic core, a standardised terminology and bolt-on specialist modules, one could imagine it being a disruptive product, creating a commodity platform. I want to see a future in which the platform becomes an interchangeable commodity with innovation and differentiation occurring at a higher conceptual level of support for medical practice. Rather than simple data collection, our mission must be to imagine a future in which medical practice, which at its most fundamental is about clinical decision making, is supported by the most sophisticated tools possible to improve patient care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mission’s greatest risk is in the continued creation of data silos in which health information is locked away in proprietary systems. The answer is to create an open, extensible platform on which innovation can thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would draw a parallel to the evolution of the Internet. In the early days of computer networking, there were many proprietary networking protocols. The advent of TCP/IP and the creation of an interoperable but layered architecture in which at the highest conceptual layer, lower level details of networking were abstracted has resulted in the thriving interconnected Internet as we know it. Similarly, we need create abstractions of our high level clinical requirements but take into account the complexities and paradoxes required in order to share private confidential medical information safely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;minimally-viable-products&quot;&gt;Minimally viable products&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always liked the concept of minimally viable products (MVP) in which one works to prove a methodology or design by creating a minimal proof-of-concept and running it in the real world&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/minimal-viable-product.png&quot; alt=&quot;Minimal Viable Product&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have built my own electronic patient record system and think it is essentially an MVP for healthcare information technology, although perhaps it has now better regarded as an actual product given it is in-use in live clinical environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, clinicians need solutions that solve their problems, and that will vary depending on their role, their speciality and their particular interests. While clinical practice and research are separate processes, having a single system that supports the collection of clinical and research data in different contexts but as part of the same record has been a powerful and valuable tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it is an NHS-hosted web-based electronic patient record system already in use for 8 years&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it now records 3000 clinical encounters every month by a wide variety of multidisciplinary teams, recording structured clinical information and embedding SNOMED-CT into clinical practice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it links to multiple PAS within different hospitals and sends clinical documents into a document repository&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it allows flexible data collection configured at runtime to support multiple cohorts of patients and the generic and disease-specific outcome measures. As such, it is used widely for multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, metabolic disease, neuromuscular disease, motor neurone disease. It is about to be used for adult cystic fibrosis services.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it uses SNOMED-CT as a lingua franca to allow loose-coupling between components and switch functionality on and off in different clinical circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it provides an Internet-hosted portal for patient reported outcomes and mobile device management&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it has client iPad applications to collect patient reported outcome measures and obtain patient consent using Apple’s ResearchKit software.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it can send alerts if patients lose weight or are admitted to hospital, based on an understanding of defined cohorts for long-term health conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it can generate clinical correspondence automatically from data entered during the day-to-day processes of clinical care&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it acts as a communication hub between different members of the team, with messages linked to the patient record&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m now working on scaling out this suite of products and the underlying data-driven principles of the architecture more generally. My goal is to create an open, semantically interoperable architecture for healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, the effective use of data is critical for patient safety, both now and in the future. So, you might expect healthcare services to have highly developed systems to allow the recording of structured longitudinal observational data?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pile-of-notes-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pile Of Notes 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, no we don’t. Instead, we largely have expensive paper records, poorly accessible with no support for team working. Paper records frequently end up poorly structured containing lots of data but in a format difficult to use in any systematic, safe or indeed automated way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;supporting-your-practice&quot;&gt;Supporting your practice&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qMsPXSMTpFI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“You’re a victim of it or a triumph because of it. The human mind simply cannot carry all the information without error so the record becomes part of your practice”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“if you can’t audit a thing for quality, it means you do not have the means to produce quality”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Dr Larry Weed, Internal Medicine Grand Rounds, 1971&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The information in the medical record isn’t something separate to the day-to-day care of an individual patient or indeed a group of patients, but instead is part of that care. However, we clinicians have historically been neglected and the information we need to run our services is not available in a routine and systematic way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should not capture information unless it is useful and, as its most fundamental, data are only useful if they influence a decision or reduce uncertainty in relation to that decision, whether it is a decision for a single patient sitting in front of you or a whole group of patients sharing some defined characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-already-collected&quot;&gt;What is already collected?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Korner report was published in 1982, there has been a commitment to routinely collect a national set of data for the management of the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result the health service &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; collect lots of data, such as the hospital episode statistics (HES):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/hes-data.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hes Data&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is illuminating to read contemporary criticism of that report such as that from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bmj.com/content/285/6350/1227&quot;&gt;Sir Douglas Black&lt;/a&gt;, then RCP president who noted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“the focus of the inquiry seems to have been on the use of information in management, not in any way as a criticism (improvement in management is both possible and desirable) but to underline that the report must be judged in that context and not in relation to other uses of information in clinical medicine or clinical epidemiology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The recommendation that diagnostic data should be collected on all patients covered by the system is to be welcomed; its omission would make these scheme &lt;em&gt;even more obviously&lt;/em&gt; a management exercise, thereby lessening its appeal to the active clinician” (my emphasis added)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Sir Douglas Black, 1982.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it is reasonable to say that the majority of clinicians have not engaged with these data, nor have they used those data to support their own practice or indeed plan their own service developments. In addition, while there are clinical coders recording diagnostic and procedural codes for inpatient episodes of care, no such information is recorded for outpatient clinics. As a result, we know how many patients are seen in our outpatient clinics, but have little idea why they are seen or how they fare. Importantly, most hospital patient administrative systems do not record information relating to any other type of patient encounter, such as telephone calls&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#telephone&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, home visits or electronic communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The limitations of HES data have been widely known; perhaps the most important limitation is that it is incomplete. As a result, those data bear little resemblance to what happens in real-life, do not recognise team-working and are not recorded by health professionals. Consequently, health professionals rarely see the data, and when they do, they scoff at its inaccuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this isn’t of only academic interest; this is serious and important to our health services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please read this extract from the Bristol children’s heart surgery report 16 years ago (2001). Are you confident that we have addressed this within the NHS in 2017?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The various clinical systems, many of them paper based, differed from one another and had no relationship with the administrative hospital-wide systems. The funding made available in the late 1980s and early 1990s for medical and later clinical audit helped to reinforce this separation by making available to groups of clinicians money for small local computer systems. The lack of any connection between these different systems, one administrative, the others clinical, for collecting data cannot be explained solely on the basis of some technical or technological reason. It was just as strongly a reflection of a mindset that clinical matters were the sole domain of clinicians and non-clinical matters, to do with the management of resources and with the movement of patients into and through the hospital, were the preserve of managers and administrators.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090811143745/http:/www.bristol-inquiry.org.uk/final_report/the_report.pdf&quot;&gt;Bristol Heart Enquiry, 2001&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;so-is-the-answer-another-registry&quot;&gt;So, is the answer another registry?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer for many clinical services appears to have been the creation of bespoke, specialty or disease-specific registries. Such registries are often created by a particular medical or surgical specialty, a disease-specific organisation such as a charity or an academic centre looking to build a cohort of patients for clinical research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/plurality-of-registries.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Plurality Of Registries&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problems with dedicated disease or speciality-specific registries are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there are lots of them, so potentially lots of disparate systems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;not embedded in day-to-day workflow&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sometimes little feedback, result or reward, particularly in any timely manner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/one-way-registry.png&quot; alt=&quot;One Way Registry&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I am in clinic, I might see consecutive patients with epilepsy, chronic fatigue syndrome, headache, and then multiple sclerosis. How can I possibly use a different clinical system for each individual patient, and what should I do if a patient has more than one problem!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important disadvantage is the lack of timely feedback for users. All clinical systems must provide value to the users of that system, with the value of a system arithmetically divided by the length of time it takes to return that value back to the user. If I am going to spend time entering information, that information must create value immediately so that we create a virtuous cycle of continuous data improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in stroke medicine, we have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strokeaudit.org&quot;&gt;Sentinal Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP)&lt;/a&gt;. This is a large-scale national audit project in which teams of health professionals perform notes review, completing data collection forms answering questions to derive data on outcomes such as “Median number of minutes per day on which physiotherapy is received”. The aggregated results for a region and comparison of these indicators with other regions are then disseminated months later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, we need systems in place that can answer that question for our current inpatients today so that, for this example, our physiotherapy colleagues can identify those patients who need to receive physiotherapy. To achieve real-time dashboards of these clinical indicators, we must provide appropriate information technology systems so that we can embed the routine and systematic collection of data into our day-to-day processes to capture data as a side-effect of our direct care, and not as an afterthought once care has been provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;so-what-is-the-answer&quot;&gt;So what is the answer?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to be ambitious and demand systems that enable intelligent and prudent healthcare. We need to start with &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/06/03/designing-future-1.html&quot;&gt;understanding our problems&lt;/a&gt;, and design our clinical information systems to solve those problems. As clinicians, we need to take ownership of the data on our patients and make data collection routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, taking a domain-driven approach to solving clinical information system design results in boiling down most of our data problems into two broad categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cohorts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Outcomes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cohort is a group of patients who share a defining characteristic, such as the same diagnosis, symptom, clinical finding, or receipt of the same procedure or treatment. I have written about the &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/04/28/importance-of-cohorts.html&quot;&gt;importance of defining cohorts previously&lt;/a&gt; and will not duplicate that post here except to say that SNOMED-CT, a comprehensive and modern terminology provides a hierarchical ontology. As a result, we can record that a patient has “Addison’s disease” (concept identifier 363732003) and determine algorithmically, by virtue of the ontology, that the patient has a type of “hypoadrenalism” (concept identifier 111563005). As such, we can then potentially identify all patients with hypoadrenalism even if they have been recorded as having “Addison’s disease”.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#snomed-understand&quot;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Value-based healthcare is predicated upon understanding and improving our patients’ health outcomes. As such, the systematic and routine collection of outcomes must underpin everything we do; what point in doing a hip replacement if we do not assess how our patient fares? Outcome data may be recorded by health professionals, but the most important outcomes are those that address the needs of our patients and as a result, patient-reported outcomes are critical in understanding how to configure and how to monitor our clinical services. In addition, there are other techniques that provide compelling real-world measures of outcome such as return to employment, need for care, long-term dependency and frequency of complications which should be combined with our other data in order to build well-rounded, comprehensive longitudinal measures of outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these two broad categories are mutually dependent. How can we interpret quality of life information without an understanding of the patient characteristics?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, SNOMED-CT permits us to understand our cohorts and partially allows us to record patient outcomes, but we must supplement SNOMED-CT with the routine collection of outcome data by professionals and by patients using a variety of disease/procedure and generic outcome tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;routine-collection-of-data&quot;&gt;Routine collection of data&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how can we build the right tools for health professionals and patients to allow the routine and systematic collection of data to support our cohorts and monitor our outcomes? Well, I’ve been trying to do this since 2009….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of recording diagnoses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cppjedy-hMo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we routinely record the toxin, dose and site of injections for our botulinum toxin clinic. It saves time for the clinician, because we can then generate the letter to the general practitioner automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgw4FRAiRVs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, each click records data as a SNOMED-CT coded procedure and site and drug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here, my iPad application collects patient reported outcome measures in the clinic and makes them immediately available to the clinician:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/GTo0fGHgoIA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pd-data.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pd Data&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pd-data-letter.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pd Data Letter&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-can-do-this-at-scale&quot;&gt;How can do this at scale?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, my software records highly structured data using SNOMED-CT and an open information model. As such, documents created using the system consist of a binary blob of data representing a PDF representation as well as a computer-readable data structure recording diagnoses, problems, procedures and interventions in a standardised way. The problem is that, presently, while I expose these data, there are no other applications running in the live clinical environment that are able to interact, yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to collect these data across all of our organisations and services:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/care-plans/patient-data-cohorts.png&quot; alt=&quot;Patient Data Cohorts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, we must stop thinking at the scale of individual services, diseases and organisations and instead recognise that we must support interoperability between multiple disparate clinical information systems across enterprises. This requires action to define appropriate data standards and data exchange, with the adoption of terminology such as SNOMED-CT and LOINC, the use of defined information models such as HL7 FHIR and openEHR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such standards must be mandated for new developments to avoid vendor lock-in, and ideally we should be building vendor-neutral archives of data that other applications, whether in-house or from third-parties, can use for data persistence and retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design of clinical systems must begin with the patient and support the provision of their care irrespective of whether they begin their journey in one organisation and continue it in another. Similarly, we need to train a cadre of experts in health informatics in order to ensure that the routine use of open, standards-backed interoperable information for healthcare is given priority in system development instead of a traditional focus on information for the &lt;em&gt;management&lt;/em&gt; of an individual organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, if you are a health professional, you must start to demand more information technology in order to support your day-to-day work looking after patients. You need systems to allow the rapid and routine collection of structured data and to be given the required tools in order to make sense of those data for your patient and your services with data linkage and realtime clinical dashboards for your services, your cohorts and your outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

Part 1 covers the &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/06/03/designing-future-1.html&quot;&gt;importance of data models&lt;/a&gt;. Part 2 covers &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/06/03/designing-future-2.html&quot;&gt;clinical modelling in relation to process and workflow&lt;/a&gt;. This part covers patient portals and the internet-of-things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we need to take several steps back from sitting in our clinics and understand what we do and where we are likely to be going in healthcare. Can we model this in an abstract and future-proof way? Can we do what we did when we &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/06/03/designing-future-2.html&quot;&gt;model a blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, but for something more complex?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is useful to imagine a patient with several long-term health conditions. These are problems that a patient will have for the rest of their life and most such conditions need ongoing monitoring. This monitoring will be usually managed by a primary care physician or a specialist and their respective teams. As such, several different professionals will be involved, including a range of administrative staff, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, third-sector providers, social services and doctors. These professionals may all work in the same organisation, but it is much more likely that they will work across organisational boundaries and yet need to collaborate and share information in supporting their patient together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, a patient is not and cannot be a passive recipient of healthcare. Instead, patients should be active members and leaders of the team, setting achievable goals and defining priorities of care. As such, patients need to be able to interact and collaborate with their teams and not only see the information relating to their care but contribute to it as well. Why do we either not measure outcomes or use surrogate proxy markers of outcomes when a patient can tell us, either directly or indirectly by virtue of their activity data, their prospectively recorded log of seizures or their home monitoring equipment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the model of care in which a patient comes for a 6-monthly outpatient clinic is outdated, inefficient and does not respect the patient - placing them in a subservient, passive role in order to receive healthcare. They arrive, sit in a waiting room, have their pulse and blood pressure measured and are weighed and then, as any who has experienced an outpatient clinic will testify, feel their autonomy fade away. We give them an appointment for six months which doesn’t fit with their schedule and will probably be cancelled. Our administrative systems track patients waiting for a new patient appointment, but patients wait for months for another follow-up slot. Information technology alone is not going to solve this, but can we step back and re-imagine our care processes and &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; information technology to enable that change?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example overview of how longitudinal prospectively collected information about a patient can be combined from disparate sources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cis_design/data_pipelines.png&quot; alt=&quot;Data Pipelines&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we make sense of step-count data without an understanding that the patient had a hip replacement in May 2017? Likewise, how can we looks at biomarkers on a serum sample taken in April 2017 without understanding the patient had a seizure the day before? We need to integrate, summarise and make available information from multiple disparate sources to the patient and those that support that patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a patient has a clinic appointment in three weeks time, it is possible to have a medical records department that fetches a set of paper notes from the archive and ensures (mostly) that I have them on my desk in clinic at the right time. This model does not scale to support a patient calling us to discuss their care or to support multiple teams looking after patients across multiple disciplines and organisations - who has got the notes? As such, we can use information technology to support a change in the way that we work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;monolithic-architectures&quot;&gt;Monolithic architectures&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early days of the Internet, we had Compuserve and later AOL. As I recall, every computer magazine had a floppy disk or later a CD-ROM with their software on it. Both were proprietary, locked-down portals accessible using a dial-up modem that offered everything from email to bulletin boards to news. As the internet took over, built on open-standards and interoperability, these systems faded into irrelevance and obsolescence. Both tried to react to the more open ‘World Wide Web’ by allowing some degree of information exchange such as permitting emails to be sent and received from the internet, but such limited interoperability was insufficient to prevent the irresistible march of progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Healthcare information technology is at a similar level of development to those systems from the 1980s and early 1990s with monolithic systems and single portals pitched as the solution to all healthcare problems. Large-scale enterprise applications (such as Epic and Cerner’s Millenium) are now installed in many hospitals and these have started offering limited interoperability in order to make their data available to other systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, those systems can offer a patient portal in which patients themselves can login and interact with that organisation and its teams. In addition, there are now increasing numbers of more consumer-focused patient portals acting as “personal health records” (PHRs) such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patientsknowbest.com&quot;&gt;Patients Know Best&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthvault.com/en-gb/&quot;&gt;HealthVault&lt;/a&gt; and Google’s (now closed) &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Health&quot;&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; PHR. An overview of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/file/3738/download?token=lPb9TkQE&quot;&gt;use of PHRs was written by the Royal College of Physicians’ Health Informatics Unit in 2016&lt;/a&gt; with a focus on PHRs provided by healthcare organisations themselves. In all cases, these products create portals to which patients may interact, and their use is principally communication between the patient and their healthcare team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantage of a monolithic system is that the patient portal can encrypt all communications between itself and the patient or their device(s) and appropriately manage the secure transmission of clinical information to and from other clinical systems within a wider healthcare enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disadvantage of a monolithic system is similar to the problems experienced by users of closed systems like Compuserve and AOL; they are locked into using that system and potentially innovative smaller enterprises become excluded from the market. If a particular provider does not support data from a particular device, such as a new product to detect seizures occurring in a patient as they sleep, then that patient cannot share that data with their healthcare team. Finally, which system should be used? Should the patient choose? Should the organisation choose? And what about patients who are looked after by multiple organisations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;can-we-do-better&quot;&gt;Can we do better?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with healthcare data is that it is private and sensitive. So how can we make healthcare data more open and more accessible and yet keep that data safe and confidential? How can we connect the patient and their devices and everyone else involved, whatever their organisation? And if we want to make healthcare data more available, won’t we exacerbate our existing explosion of data and will need tools to make sense of that information. I don’t want to have to read through all of the day-to-day nursing notes recorded when a patient was an inpatient to find that critical piece of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need systems that can make health information more widely available within our NHS network between NHS organisations, but that is insufficient. We also need to extend our reach to the patient, to other care providers such as social services and the third-sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what do we need?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A secure but open distributed infrastructure:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Solve the seemingly mutually exclusive goals of security and availability. I think the answer will have to come in a future blog post, but we need to consider how to make a secure, distributed, decentralised infrastructure on which open standards permit semantic interoperability between disparate systems. We think that there are some clever ways that this might be achieved.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Can such a system adopt both a messaging function, in which electronic communication can be sent securely from one end-point to another, but also a publish-subscribe (multicast) model in which different services contribute and receive information about their patients?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support data standards and semantic interoperability with clinical modelling for data and process:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Build tools to capture structured data at the point-of-care, and make entering structured data easier to do than entering unstructured free text.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Build tools to turn unstructured data into structured information by advances in natural language processing.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Build tools to support making sense of large amounts of unstructured and structured information in a variety of different clinical, professional and personal contexts.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Understand what we mean by a clinical service and a team, not defined by an organisation but how they &lt;em&gt;work together&lt;/em&gt; for a patient.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Essentially, we need an “information superhighway” for healthcare, in which we can exchange communications securely and yet privately between multiple end-points&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the problems with the secure exchange of information is that, while we can encrypt the contents of my message, the metadata (data about data) leaks confidential information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/communication/msg-leaking-metadata.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Msg Leaking Metadata&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this rather contrived example, you can see that I sent some information to the genito-urinary clinic and then received some information back. You can guess that a result was included as the laboratory has also been involved. You don’t need to see the contents to make some inferences about what is happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaking information via your metadata is even more problematic for electronic communications. If my patient sends and receives electronic communication to a HIV helpline address, that information tells me something important and leaks private information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any distributed system connecting patients and their devices to our healthcare enterprises needs to solve this privacy concern.&lt;/p&gt;

This part covers clinical modelling in relation to process and workflow.

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post-it-note.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Post It Note&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I want to talk about how we model clinical information systems and how communication between patients, professionals and services underpins all that we do in healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, my arguments are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is easy to see information technology (IT) as a product to be deployed: “drop it in and all will be well”. This isn’t true. Instead, IT should be used to support existing workflow and planned changes in that workflow to improve patient care. You need to therefore understand workflow.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This boils down to understanding how we work in teams and how those relationships between people need to be modelled within any computer system designed to support healthcare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Healthcare is all about communication: between patient and the team and between team members and the services that we use. The communication may be a patient phoning us, but it is much more that that. For example, the communication from the laboratory to us on the ward relating to the results of a blood investigation such as a renal function test or a full blood count, the discussion I have with a colleague about the most appropriate next step or my request for that MRI scan of the brain sent from my clinic this morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is easy to forget and instead see technology as an answer itself. As such, we end up with a read-only portal to which I login to see a list of patients on the ward, a list of pending outpatient referrals and a chronological list of investigations for that patient. Such software has been created in response to a requirement such as “allow the professionals to see all of the results”, which seems like an entirely reasonable statement of the requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But has that requirement been correctly scoped?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;poor-scoping-and-the-mismatched-model&quot;&gt;Poor scoping and the mismatched model&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to step back and consider all of the information flows that exist, and particularly note the difference between “push” and “pull” communications. A “push” communication is a message that you receive as an active process : a letter is posted through your letterbox, a result is placed on your desk, the laboratory phones you because the haemoglobin is very low. A “pull” communication is something you fetch yourself : you go and read the noticeboard, you look through a list of results on the computer, you look through the notes to find a filed letter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, information technology in healthcare has adopted a “pull” model for end-users because there was no practical way of offering “push” notifications. This is an interesting paradox because at a technological level, most health enterprises have used “push” messaging (HL7) to integrate different systems within their architecture. There are many reasons why end-users have missed out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How could a system stand any chance of sending a blood result to the right person when, as designed, no computer could work out to whom to send the result? The request was made on paper, with an illegible name for the consultant, and no way of knowing which professionals worked in which team.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do push notifications work when ward computers are used by multiple users, many of whom move around every few months? Users did not carry personal devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet so many processes are predicated upon a “push” model, in which the receipt of a communication (a request or a result of a test), is an integral part of the workflow of a service. The team need to know the result of the blood test in order to send the patient home; a delay in getting that blood test results in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://qir.bmj.com/content/5/1/u209098.w3772.full&quot;&gt;late discharge and a consequent effect on hospital bed efficiencies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I still get a lot of “push” notifications: my office is cluttered with paper records, post-it notes and a paper inbox. Similarly, I have NHS email with an electronic inbox that fills up with alarming rapidity with stuff for me to do but none of those emails end up linked into the patient record and are not visible to anyone else in the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pile-of-notes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pile Of Notes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as email is not designed as a system to manage workflow, these different systems are not joined up and do not support me in my care for patients. Most of us set-up workaround systems that mean that when we sign off typed letters, we get the notes and can check the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The systems I have to use don’t support the clinical processes I need in order to provide safe, good care. I have solutions that have been poorly scoped, poorly thought through and a mismatch between reality and the implicit or explicit model underlying those solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need help!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;modelling-process&quot;&gt;Modelling process&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the examples above demonstrate, I now receive a variety of healthcare information via paper, traditional email, and existing organisation-provided and national all-Wales portals. I also receive messages within my own homegrown electronic patient record system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paper post-it notes and my in-tray on my shelf do not support modern ways of working and timely collaboration of patient care, but at least there is no mismatch in the process. I request something, the result is posted back, an administrator bundles the result with the notes and I can deal with it. It is a workflow that is generally safe, if not rather old-fashioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My health board turned off paper reports for laboratory investigations. I currently receive no notifications about results, whether normal or abnormal. It is left to chance, unless I make a habit of always checking results whenever I sign off letters. This is a process model mismatch. I have to login and manually check results for patients under my care and there is currently no way of knowing that someone has dealt with a result. Now we’re starting to fix this as part of the Welsh Clinical Portal project within NHS Wales but there is more work to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the PatientCare EPR, I built a model for rapid team-based, patient-linked electronic communication. While not perfect, it builds in a task-manager so that users can track what they have and have not dealt with. At the time of writing, users have sent 57,412 messages between each other with 45,743 explicitly linked to a patient record. Users now send over 1,000 messages per month to one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/patientcare-messages.png&quot; alt=&quot;Patientcare Messages&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the graph shows, the vast majority of messages are sent by administrators and by specialist nurses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many different ways of supporting team communication and it is important for users to be able to send messages from lots of different contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first context is the software’s encounter wizard, which can be used to record clinic encounters, ward reviews or telephone calls (or any other user-defined service-specific type of encounter):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/communication/msg-encounter-wizard.png&quot; alt=&quot;Msg Encounter Wizard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you see an administrator recording encounters against two patients. Those encounters will be recorded in the longitudinal record for that patient automatically. For each encounter, a user has the option of sending a message to a colleague. As such, in one click, the user records both an encounter with the patient and informs someone else of the need to do something. Once created, at any time a user can see a list of encounter. Users are able to filter the list depending on a range of different characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/communication/msg-encounter-list.png&quot; alt=&quot;Msg Encounter List&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we can also see a pure list of the messages for that patient, irrespective of whether an encounter exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/communication/msg-message-view.png&quot; alt=&quot;Msg Message View&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we can create a message directly from the patient’s record:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/communication/msg-simple.png&quot; alt=&quot;Msg Simple&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users can choose whether to receive an email notification about secure messages received. If all our users had their own personal handheld devices, a push notification would work similarly. In addition, within the PatientCare EPR, they have a simple inbox functionality to see their unread messages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/communication/msg-inbox.png&quot; alt=&quot;Msg Inbox&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to facilitate task management, messages can be flagged as complete:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/communication/msg-completed.png&quot; alt=&quot;Msg Completed&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important feature is that the contents of the communications are available to all members of the team looking after that patient, because it is recorded within the patient record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-model-for-the-future&quot;&gt;A model for the future&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, patients and users are explicitly linked to one another via the concept of “episodes of care” and “user registration”. As such, the system supports a finely-grained security model in which we can vouch that a particular health professional has a direct-care relationship with a specific patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/care-plans/patient-project-membership.png&quot; alt=&quot;Patient Project Membership&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our services for long-term health conditions, the episode is lifelong as you would expect. For more acute services, such as our liaison neurology service, the system closes episodes after a custom defined period (e.g. 3 months). At any point, users with the correct permissions can themselves can register patients to a service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of this information and process model, the software is a fine abstraction of the real-world, making it more likely that it can be repurposed for future needs. This approach creates systems that have longevity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this modelling of real-life processes and communication, it is easy to see how dealing with communications from patients could work. Rather than communications being sent to an individual health professional, who conceivably may be on leave or unable to respond, building a process and information model that mimics real-life offers the potential to build true team/patient communication. Likewise, the same model works for data from the patient’s own devices, whether they be home-monitors or wearables.&lt;/p&gt;

This post covers the importance of data models. Part 2 covers &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/06/03/designing-future-2.html&quot;&gt;clinical modelling in relation to process and workflow&lt;/a&gt;. Part 3 covers &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/06/03/designing-future-3.html&quot;&gt;patient portals and the internet-of-things&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two fundamental principles that we must consider when designing clinical information systems for the future:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We can’t build perfect systems straightaway; if we wait until everything is perfect, we’ll never get anything done.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We shouldn’t give up on creating perfect systems. We’ll never achieve perfection of course, because they will always be something even &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; to implement, so we need a roadmap for stuff we need to solve now, solve tomorrow and solve in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusion is, therefore, we must get technology in the hands of users, but plan to iterate and try to design systems that are future-proof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, information technology (IT) is not something that one can buy, deploy and then sit back and bask in the glory of improved efficiency and streamlined processes. Instead, we need to consider how our clinical processes work now, how they might, could or should work in the future and build systems that support those processes. At the very least, our designs should not unnecessarily limit our ability to adapt to new ways of working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of us have all of the answers at this point in time, so what can we do to create future-proof systems that solve problems now that don’t unnecessarily limit our future scope and prevent future innovation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is to develop clinical models of data and the processes and workflows relating to those data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start with our data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;clinical-modelling&quot;&gt;Clinical modelling&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I can draw a parallel between software engineering and a famous Danish interlocking brick toy company?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that toy company creates a model with blocks that are specific to that model, only usable in the construction of that car or boat or train, then it might be possible to try to re-purpose those blocks to build an aeroplane, but it is much less likely. Conversely, creating a wide-range of general purpose blocks means that those blocks can be re-used in hundreds of different applications right now and in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I opined in my &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/02/03/domain-driven-design.html&quot;&gt;Domain-driven clinical design document&lt;/a&gt;, the same is true in software. The best way of creating systems that solve problems right now and support our future iterative development efforts is to start with open and standard data structures with a core focus on interoperability. I cannot overstate the importance of supporting interoperability, even in the unlikely event that you think you don’t need to interoperate with any other system right now. Baking in interoperability forces you and your team to make the right decisions when it comes to designing an architecture to support your software. I have heard people argue that interoperability is something “nice to have” but we’ve “got to get something done” as if designing systems properly will somehow slow or impede development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the designers of the interlocking brick systems have a problem. They can’t know what bricks to make until they start thinking about the toys they want to be able to build with those bricks, but they can’t design the toys until they know which bricks they have available. So they need to ensure their teams work iteratively, bringing people together with different skills, using some common basic bricks and adding more specialised bricks for certain use-cases. Likewise, in software, modelling data and process requires an understanding of both and how they might be used now and changed in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we can make it easier for ourselves. We can begin with modelling the easy things: won’t a blood pressure recorded in millimetres of mercury will always be a blood pressure recorded in millimetres of mercury? Well yes, but don’t we also need to codify who took it, when they took it, how they took it, and what the patient was doing at the time? How can we create a representation in a computer that is re-usable and understandable by multiple systems? So now we need something to represent “120/70 mmHg taken in the right arm by Dr Wardle in the sitting position at rest using a manual sphygmomanometer”. But what about a blood pressure taken using a transducer from an arterial line in the intensive care unit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So suddenly we need to start thinking not just about representing a numeric value in specified units but all of the additional metadata. We are building an information model to represent a real-life concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, someone has done most of the work for us already. Read Dr Heather Leslie’s (@omowizard) blog post about blood pressure to see how openEHR provides a rich model of the concept of blood pressure. Similarly, the HL7 FHIR observation resource provides a simpler but similar representation with metadata represented either as a choice of options in openEHR or using a standardised terminology such as SNOMED-CT for FHIR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, there are already a large number of archetypes defined within openEHR representing a wide-range of clinical concepts. Similarly, HL7 FHIR already supports exposing a great variety of (similar) clinical concepts as part of an API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;openEHR clinical knowledge manager: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openehr.org/ckm/&quot;&gt;http://www.openehr.org/ckm/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HL7 FHIR 3.0.1 resources: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resourcelist.html&quot;&gt;https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resourcelist.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;next-steps&quot;&gt;Next steps&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future of healthcare systems is based on open-standards and semantic interoperability in which multiple systems can share information about patients. We can use vendor-neutral archives for data persistence of openEHR archetypes or expose proprietary legacy information to other systems using a standardised HL7 FHIR API. Whatever the case, starting with our data allows us to solve our immediate problems and permits ongoing iterative development to use that information in new and innovative ways in order to support the care of patients.&lt;/p&gt;

There is a lot I haven’t really mentioned and so, I thought I’d add some details over a few other blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A care plan is a document that sets out a patient’s future care and support. Patients should be fully involved in the preparation of such a care plan and ideally this plan should contain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what are the intended &lt;em&gt;outcomes&lt;/em&gt; for a patient, including wishes and preferences.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an assessment of the &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; of a patient in order to achieve those outcomes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how those needs are to be &lt;em&gt;met by the agencies&lt;/em&gt; involved in supporting that patient&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, a care plan should be individualised and specific for a single patient and will need to include plans for the care in a range of care domains, such as medical, nursing and social.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are types of care plans aimed at different scenarios, such as an emergency care plan to document a plan of care should there be an emergency deterioration in a patient’s health. Such a plan would focus on ensuring that emergency unit staff know what to do and this kind of plan can be particularly helpful for patients with long-term health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;care-plans-within-the-patientcare-epr&quot;&gt;Care plans within the PatientCare EPR.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have built an emergency care plan registry within the PatientCare EPR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/care-plans/schematic-care-plan.png&quot; alt=&quot;Schematic Care Plan&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea being that we could configure our emergency unit system to check for the presence of an emergency care plan via a REST API and ensure that caregivers have access to that plan in safely and securely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;building-individualised-plans&quot;&gt;Building individualised plans&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modelling care plans requires an understanding of the processes and workflow that create and maintain those plans. As such, it is not sufficient to simply model the data relating to a care plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, care plans are typically collaborative documents in which multiple authors work to create a unified document. In addition, the users involved need to know the care plans for which they are responsible. Most importantly, how many of us have seen guidelines, protocols and care plans with an expiry date many months or years in the past? As such, it is vital that there are processes in place to identify out-of-date care plans and ensure that they are kept up to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, healthcare professionals have relied on patients turning up in clinic in order to drive their healthcare. This is an outdated and inefficient way of running a health service. If we truly want a responsive service, we need to ensure that information technology is used to its fullest in order to enable care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/care-plans/first-draft.png&quot; alt=&quot;First Draft&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this first screenshot, we generate a care plan. It is automatically populated by the contents of the emergency care guidance from any clinical services for which the patient is registered. I can add a number of users so for example, if I have a paediatric patient with epilepsy and nutritional problems, one section may the responsibility of a paediatric neurologist and the other a gastroenterologist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each user can edit or add new sections and order those sections:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/care-plans/seizures.png&quot; alt=&quot;Seizures&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which then populate the care plan document:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/care-plans/second-draft.png&quot; alt=&quot;Second Draft&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users can choose the review date and the expiry date and users receive notifications when a care plan needs to be reviewed or signed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a user signs off the document, the content is locked until either all users have signed it off, or someone unlocks the document. Only after all users sign off the document is it finally &lt;a href=&quot;/images/care-plans/care-plan.pdf&quot;&gt;published to the repository&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/care-plans/final-output.png&quot; alt=&quot;Final Output&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;but-how-can-we-do-this-for-thousands-of-patients&quot;&gt;But how can we do this for thousands of patients?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Care plans are particularly useful for those patients with complex needs and multiple co-morbidities. For such patients, it is easy to see how investing time and resource in preparing and maintaining emergency care plans can improve patient care in the event of an emergency. But how can we do this for all of the patients under our care?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the PatientCare EPR, all patients are registered to clinical services and projects by virtue of an episode of care. This episode may be lifelong for a long-term health condition, or short for an acute clinical service. As health professionals are registered with different roles to different services, this permits a finely grained security model in which only those staff involved in the direct care of that patient has access to the record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/care-plans/patient-project-membership.png&quot; alt=&quot;Patient Project Membership&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this model provides a way of building dynamic care plans for all of the patients under our care. As such, the PatientCare EPR can automatically generate a default care plan individualised to that patient by virtue of that patient’s membership of different clinical teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/care-plans/editing-service-care-plan.png&quot; alt=&quot;Editing Service Care Plan&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I edit the configuration for a local Parkinson’s disease service. This will be used to automatically generate a care plan for the patients registered to that service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have built a REST-based API that looks for manually-created emergency care plan but, if that doesn’t exist and the clinical services are configured to have “automatic care plan generation” turned on, the system will dynamically generate a document for the use of emergency services.&lt;/p&gt;

It is underpinned by SNOMED-CT, a modern sophisticated and comprehensive terminology system that acts as the ‘lingua franca’ to provide algorithmic understanding and dynamic functionality. While the main functionality is available via a web-based portal, users can also interact with the software using bespoke iPhone and iPad applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has resulted in clinical information becoming available immediately at the point-of-care. The neuro-inflammatory team used to use paper notes with filing cabinets full of brown folders; now they are paper-free. It records not only a prospective longitudinal narrative, acting as a customer-relationship-manager, but records both clinician-derived and patient reported outcome measures. In addition, while fundamentally it is a system to support the direct care of patients, it additionally supports the dynamic real-time aggregation of data for service management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it supports the registration and management of clinical research projects, managing consent and access privileges using a finely-grained security model. This allows the recording of deep clinical phenotypes combined with a record of biological samples such as plasma, serum, DNA and cerebrospinal fluid. As such, we not only know that the serum was taken from a patient with, for example, epilepsy, but we also know how that biological sample was taken on the same day as a generalised tonic-clonic seizure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been building this system since 2009. This blog post is an overview of the functionality available and the underlying design principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;1-start-with-a-problem&quot;&gt;1. Start with a problem&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When designing clinical information systems, the priority must be to solve a problem. It is therefore vital to understand and frame the problems, work on making those problems as generic as possible without losing functionality, and plan for a phased iterative development in which early designs are built with future needs in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important problem we face in hospital medicine is an understanding of our patients and their outcomes. You might be surprised to know that my own organisation knows how many patients attend outpatient clinics, but they have little idea why they were seen, what had been done or how they have fared. Indeed, there are now ongoing projects to record patient outcome measures from patients when their appointment letters are sent to them, but how can anyone interpret those data without an understanding of the problems those patients face?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example problems might include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How many patients with [Parkinson’s disease] in Wales?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How many patients with [epilepsy] refractory to two drugs?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who might be eligible for this new [treatment / research project / intervention]?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who of my patients is taking [methotrexate] and need monitoring?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tell me when any of my patients with [epilepsy] attends A&amp;amp;E.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tell me when my patient loses 5% of their body weight compared to weight at diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do patients fare after having a [ventriculo-peritoneal shunt] procedure?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This information is actually available, but it will generally be recorded in individual patient notes. The only way of knowing how many patients we see with Parkinson’s disease for example would be to task someone to go through the paper records or outpatient letters and manually count them up. Therefore, while this information is available, it isn’t accessible at the point of care or in any format that permits dynamic, real-time monitoring and understand of our clinical services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PatientCare EPR supports solving all of these problems, but does so by creating a generic solution applicable to a wide-range of clinical problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;2-move-to-a-model&quot;&gt;2. Move to a model&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you know the problems that need to be solved, it is tempting to start thinking about how your clinical information system is going to look and behave. However,  you should instead consider your high-level functional requirements and the model of the world that will support those requirements. I write about clinical modelling in my &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/02/03/domain-driven-design.html&quot;&gt;Domain-driven clinical design document&lt;/a&gt; but essentially a model is an abstraction of reality. Clinical modelling requires both time and collaboration, between experts in the problem domain and experts with the required technical skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest dividing clinical modelling into three related steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Modelling data within a medical record&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Modelling processes and workflow relating to a medical record&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implementation of a clinical model into a workable and practical solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These three steps should be considered separately but are dependent on one another and inherently depend on the functional requirements. In designing clinical information systems, a data model may change infrequently or a design may even be correct in perpetuity; a systolic blood pressure recorded using a cuff on the right arm of an individual will always be a systolic blood pressure recorded using a cuff on the right arm of an individual. However, a model of the processes of care will likely change more frequently as a result of changes in working practices and service design, and an implementation may change even more frequently as a result of new technologies and devices.
As each step is dependent on each other, modelling must be an iterative work with feedback loops between all steps rather than performed in sequence by different members of the team. An implementation cannot be designed without consideration of the data structures and processes that leverage the data within those structures and a model cannot be designed unless it is practical and efficient to perform an implementation. It also follows that clinical modelling must be performed by a team of individuals with a range of skills including those with important domain knowledge such as health professionals as well as those responsible for the design and implementation of the resulting software such as technical architects and software developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as part of this iteration, I don’t suggest trying to do detailed planning. Historically, the health service has developed software by providing detailed requirements and planning systems in detail with the stages of development build using a Gantt chart. Advocates of such an approach suggest that this lowers risk and maps the process of development from initiation to final deployment. The use of a Gantt chart typically creates a project plan that looks like a waterfall, and so this is typically termed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model&quot;&gt;“waterfall model”&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, I would advocate a more agile and iterative approach in which the three related steps of clinical modelling listed above are used as part of a series experiments in order to test those models and our assumptions and ensure that what will be created will actually be valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;3-example-requirements&quot;&gt;3 Example requirements&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be useful to consider some examples of functional requirements and the data required to solve those problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;support-the-derivation-of-incidence-and-prevalence-of-a-range-of-rare-diseases&quot;&gt;Support the derivation of incidence and prevalence of a range of rare diseases&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this task, we might consider first how to calculate incidence and prevalence and decide that we need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a list of patients, including dates of birth and death&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;their current and previous addresses and the dates on which they moved.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a method to map addresses to wider geographic areas, such as health authority boundaries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a record of diagnoses and the dates of both diagnosis and onset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these data, it is conceivable that we can generate incidence and prevalence data for any disease at any time point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PatientCare EPR has underpinned our local multiple sclerosis epidemiology projects for many years. At the touch of a button, I can generate incident and prevalence data. Here is an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/patientcare-epidem-data.png&quot; alt=&quot;Patientcare Epidem Data&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;send-an-alert-when-one-of-my-patients-with-mnd-loses-5-of-their-body-weight&quot;&gt;Send an alert when one of my patients with MND loses 5% of their body weight&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a list of patients&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a record of diagnoses and the dates of both diagnosis and onset.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a way of identifying motor neurone disease whether the patient is recorded as having “MND” or a subtype such as “progressive bulbar palsy”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a longitudinal record of body weight&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a method to track clinical users and handle notifications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PatientCare EPR does this dynamically and presents the information in a dashboard, but also sends me an alert when it recognises a patient has lost weight:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mnd-dashboard.png&quot; alt=&quot;Mnd Dashboard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;show-me-how-this-patient-with-multiple-sclerosis-is-doing-compared-to-their-peers&quot;&gt;Show me how this patient with multiple sclerosis is doing compared to their peers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a list of patients&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a record of diagnosis and the dates of both diagnosis and onset.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a longitudinal record of disease outcome, perhaps generic, perhaps disease-specific, perhaps both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this image, progression of disability for the whole cohort is shown (dotted lines indicated median and centiles) with an individual’s progress overlaid. In addition, my colleagues can dynamically change the inclusion and exclusion criteria that defines the cohort. For example, a man presenting with multiple sclerosis at the age of 35 can be shown against other men presenting between age 30 and 40 to easily see how the individual is doing compared to their peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/edss-graph.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Edss Graph&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;record-patient-encounters-such-as-telephone-calls-and-allow-team-working&quot;&gt;Record patient encounters such as telephone calls and allow team-working&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a list of patients&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a list of teams&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a list of users&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;linkage between patients, teams and users in order to support team working and understand who is involved in the care of whom&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;security access control to use that linkage to decide on patient record access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PatientCare EPR now records thousands of messages every month. Users can choose to receive emails when a message is sent, with the software sending messages with patient identifiable information if they have an NHS email account but only a notification if they have registered with a non-NHS account such as their university email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/patientcare-messages.png&quot; alt=&quot;Patientcare Messages&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;4-solving-our-problems&quot;&gt;4. Solving our problems&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that many of these functional requirements are generic and widely-applicable, irrespective of disease, treatment or intervention. Indeed, why limit comparing a single patient with their peers based only on diagnosis? Instead, consider how one might design systems that allow such comparisons based on other characteristics, such as a particular type of procedure, an admission under a particular specialty or an outpatient appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A focus on the user interface means that when one broadens the scope of a problem, it is possible to create complexity and confusion. However, broadening the scope of a problem at a domain-model level often simplifies our work, by providing insight into how one requirement is in fact closely related to another. Defining the appropriate scope of a problem is therefore critical to create usable, workable and valuable clinical information systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially we need to build an information model representing the data and the relationships between those items of data. Such modelling requires an understanding of the “nouns” in healthcare as well as the processes (the “verbs”) that represent actions on those nouns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, no solution exists in isolation. Instead, any clinical information system must interoperate with other systems within a wider health enterprise, either within a single organisation or, increasingly, across organisations. There is now increasing momentum towards open architectures in which healthcare data can be represented in a standardised fashion and I have written about openEHR, HL7 FHIR and SNOMED-CT in my &lt;a href=&quot;/cis-design/2017/05/02/data-standards.html&quot;&gt;data standards blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;snomed-ct&quot;&gt;SNOMED-CT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have previously also discussed SNOMED-CT in detail (in discussing the &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/04/28/importance-of-cohorts.html&quot;&gt;importance of cohorts&lt;/a&gt;, in releasing an &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/04/29/rsterminology-part2.html&quot;&gt;open-source SNOMED-CT terminology server&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/05/20/using-snomed-ct.html&quot;&gt;using SNOMED CT to understand meaning&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, SNOMED-CT provides two key features that underpin solving many of our clinical problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, it provides a terminology, a list of terms representing clinical and non-clinical concepts. Therefore, rather than users typing “MI” or “myocardial infarction” or misspelling “mlutiople sclerosis”, it allows the mapping of user entered information into concept identifiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it provides an understanding to the computer what those concepts actually mean. This allows computer code to understand that “multiple sclerosis” is a type of “demyelinating disease” for example. The relationships within SNOMED-CT essentially provide a database of clinical semantic knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two features mean that SNOMED-CT is a powerful tool in creating modern clinical systems that can not only provide powerful functionality to allow users to record problems, diagnoses and other information but also exchange that information with other systems within the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do I use SNOMED-CT within PatientCare?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a screenshot recording SNOMED-CT in the clinic. For each click, the terms “Injection of botulinum toxin” and the brand (e.g. “dysport”) are recorded within an information model that also records who injected, when and how much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/patientcare-botox.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Patientcare Botox&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, users do not know they are entering SNOMED CT codes when they use these electronic forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cppjedy-hMo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to see a demonstration of entering clinical information in this way, try my &lt;a href=&quot;https://msdata.org.uk/apps/WebObjects/SnomedBrowser.woa/&quot;&gt;online demo application&lt;/a&gt;. It is very simple, but it shows you how entered free text can be mapped quickly and efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;5-design-for-the-future&quot;&gt;5. Design for the future&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I sat down to design the architecture that underpins the PatientCare EPR, I planned for a future in which I would combine multiple disparate sources of information to build a complete picture of a single patient and groups of patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I viewed the overall flow of data like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cis_design/data_pipelines.png&quot; alt=&quot;Data Pipelines&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I write, I now have completed almost all of the modules required in this schematic. I don’t yet have any apps on any app store for patients to use directly, but am piloting clinic-based applications to record patient-reported outcome measures and consent to research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, we are now able to see a combined view of data from multiple sources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/seizure-frequency.png&quot; alt=&quot;Seizure Frequency&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we see a patient’s seizures together with their drug regime over time. This is not computerised decision-making, but the computer making the &lt;em&gt;right information available at the right time&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pd-data.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pd Data&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we see the structured data recorded for a patient with Parkinson’s disease. Instead of trying to capture data from free-text, we record structured data in an efficient way and then generate our summary correspondence from that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pd-data-letter.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pd Data Letter&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have added a complete REST API to allow other applications to liberate the data held within the PatientCare EPR to authorised users or their agents, but there are very few other systems that have adopted either a standardised information model or terminology. The clinical documents that are created are not simply binary blobs of data with unstructured information, but carefully modelled documents with links to the users, the locations, the type of encounter, the diagnoses, medications and procedures, coded and structured. Unfortunately, there are few other systems that can leverage that information yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this video, I build an electronic consent form within the web-based EPR. An iPad application connects to the EPR using a REST API, downloads the consent form and information about a research project and, while recording patient outcomes directly from the patient, also asks them whether they want to sign-up. Their consent and their outcome measures are then immediately sent back into the EPR and are incorporated into the generated clinical correspondence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/59tGM85zzlY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last video demonstrates the working of the EPR in the motor neurone disease clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/DGvCzfhOoN0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;statistics&quot;&gt;Statistics&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Over 60,000 lines of code&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;9 years of “spare time” development (evenings and weekends)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3000 clinical encounters recorded every month by hundreds of users for direct patient care and clinical research&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Over 20,000 patients and their outcomes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Running on a Linux server sitting in an NHS Wales data centre.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-future-plans&quot;&gt;My future plans&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have worked single-handedly on this software for many years but now find myself turning away people who want to use the system as I do not have time to add new functionality and offer support outside of Wales. I have dabbled with outsourcing and subcontracting development work but I would really love to work with others on solving problems in healthcare using information technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if you are interested in business development or a partnership or are an IT developer who doesn’t simply want to work on a contract basis, but is interested in what I’m trying to do, I’d be interested in hearing from you. I have some recurring income from the software (from the NHS) which can pay for part-time salaries in the short-term but I think the goal would be to work on seeking investment and then really trying to grow the business. Perhaps it is better as a social enterprise, a charity or a for-profit company. I’m open to ideas. Let me know!&lt;/p&gt;
