&lt;p&gt;Medical data are complex and heterogeneous with individual patient records combining multiple disparate sources of information including :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;administrative data, scheduling and context (e.g. outpatient neurology clinic - movement disorders)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;patient reported outcome and experience measures  (e.g. “I can walk”, “he was rude”)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;clinical diagnostic, procedural and outcome measures    (e.g. “multiple sclerosis”)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;diagnostic synthesis and management plans  (e.g. “offer a new high-risk disease modifying treatment”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between those categories, it is possible that we can answer the what, who, how and possibly the why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What many people don’t realise is that the interpretation of medical data, irrespective of its form, depends, to a variable degree on everything else. The most important dependency, in my view, is the context in which those data were acquired. This need for interpretation is why the phrase, “the single source of truth”, when used in building health record software, is only a partially useful mantra; it hopefully encourages a data-focused, clinical modelling approach but it inappropriately suggests that there is a “single truth”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you need to re-appraise how you consider, for example, “problem lists” - and understand that the meaning of “angina”, whether encoded as a consecutive array of letters of the alphabet (e.g. in English: “a-n-g-i-n-a” as free text) or encoded using a code from a medical terminology or classification system (e.g. in SNOMED-CT: Angina (disorder) SCTID: 194828000 with synonyms: Angina, Cardiac angina, Angina pectoris, Stenocardia,  Anginal syndrome, AP - Angina pectoris, Ischemic heart disease - angina, Ischaemic heart disease - angina,   Angina (disorder)) cannot be understood without contextual information, including the series of logical inferences that resulted in that diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, you should regard a diagnosis of “angina” with skepticism if it was given by me, a consultant neurologist but you might trust my diagnosis of “myasthenia gravis” even if the antibody test for that condition is negative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even data sourced from an accredited laboratory requires careful interpretation. A single test might be a false-negative result unless there is 100% sensitivity. Likewise, a positive test may be false-positive unless there is 100% specificity; either scenario would be extremely unusual indeed. In addition, tests, such as laboratory tests may be combined to improve their predictive power. It becomes even more complex as sensitivity and specificity depends on the &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; probability of that test in that population. As a result the interpretation of a test or combination of tests depends on the context in which those tests were performed. A positive test result performed as the result of screening a whole unselected population has less importance than a test performed in a patient suspected of having the disease in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if a laboratory test does not perfectly predict a disease, we can easily see how more subjective, opinion-based tests and diagnostic processes such as radiology or getting a clinical opinion in an outpatient clinic, will suffer from the same issues. In particular, if a report changes (and they do) or clinical opinions vary (fairly common) then “truth” becomes a poor conceptual foundation for our electronic health systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logical conclusion  is that there is no single “truth”, but instead a deeply hierarchical, nested inter-dependent, frequently correlated set of multi-dimensional data. Does it matter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;data-for-decision-making&quot;&gt;Data for decision-making&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve written about measurement &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/06/20/machine-learning-2.html&quot;&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt; concluding that medical data, whether a measurement of a physiological parameter, a laboratory test result or report from a radiological investigation, is useful only in &lt;em&gt;reducing the uncertainty around a decision&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, we perform measurements, of whatever type, to support decision making and conceptually, those decisions may be grouped into three broad categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the direct care of that patient&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the care of groups of patients within our clinical service(s) and organisations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;clinical research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we have measurements that don’t influence current or future decisions in any of these domains, then we must ask ourselves why are we performing and recording those measurements at all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if we have imperfect measurements that are not 100% sensitive or 100% specific, then we have to ask, sensitive and specific to &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt;? Realising this provides an important insight: when applied, say to clinical diagnosis, is that almost all of our measurements in medicine are as if we are looking at the truth out of the corner of our eye. We cannot see the &lt;em&gt;hidden truth&lt;/em&gt; but a combination of our measurements are, together, governed by a few simpler variables or concepts that are actually the cause of the results of the measurements that we can measure. As a result, we hope that our measurements can be used to understand the &lt;em&gt;latent&lt;/em&gt; variable(s) that are actually the hidden cause of those measurements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, sometimes we get an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) result. It is usually raised in certain types of inflammatory or infectious disorders. It is like the smoke from a fire in a forest, we see the smoke from our helicopter but do not necessarily the cause of the fire. If the patient has had a cough for three days and has a fever, and when we listen to the chest there are crepitations in the right lower zone and the CRP is raised, the diagnosis is likely to be a community-acquired pneumonia. We have to take into account the &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; probability as well, which means that we consider common causes more frequently than rare causes. Likewise, if the patient has had a cough for three months then we might reach a different conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, when we consider clinical diagnosis, our combination of multi-dimensional &lt;em&gt;measurements&lt;/em&gt; is providing us with a probabilistic determination of a specific considered diagnosis. Over time and with experience, most clinicians build up a set of heuristics that imperfectly approximate this diagnostic process and learn a range of practical short-cuts in order to cope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has always been a surprise to me that we have not yet developed tools to support this fundamentally complex and difficult problem; while we teach “red flags” to aid the identification of the unusual patient (e.g. a headache that is the worst ever headache), such decision-support aids remain crude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;nested-data&quot;&gt;Nested data&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we know a patient has a history of angina and presents with chest pain, understanding how and why that &lt;em&gt;label&lt;/em&gt; of “angina” was given is important. In fact, what does that label actually mean? Is it the diagnosis given by a consultant cardiologist or, inappropriately by a rather over-enthusiastic neurologist?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re actually using the term “angina” to represent an approximate and subjective clinical concept as an abbreviation rather than endlessly writing down the multiple logical inferences made in order to determine that the patient suffered, for example, chest pain on exertion and had a stent placed for stenosis in her coronary circulation. It is a placeholder that actually hides a lot of potential complexity and permits professionals and patients to communicate and make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fractal/angina-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Angina 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we see that a constellation of information (our measurements, binary choices or continuous variables) allows us to apply a pragmatic diagnostic label, “angina”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except is that right? What is the point of that label unless it too is useful for future decision making? If I visit the catheter laboratory and ask my cardiology colleague for a coronary angiogram because a patient has “angina”, they’ll want to interrogate that diagnostic label in much greater detail to make a decision about whether a patient should have a specific intervention. They will want to know more than simply “angina”!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our measurements and our labels are therefore interpretable and usable only in a specific context and for a specific set of circumstances in order to make a decision to effect care. Indeed, for future care, perhaps the diagnosis of “angina” is less useful than an understanding of pathology : ie whether the patient has significant arteriosclerotic vascular disease or not; after all, perhaps that is the biggest predictor of future cardiac events?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fractal/angina-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Angina 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we see &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; we use information when a patient presents to the emergency department with new crushing chest pain. Clinical decisions at the front door can simply use our placeholder diagnostic lists in order to action safe care and combine that historic information (that the patient has proven coronary artery disease) together with new information to make a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;fractal-data&quot;&gt;Fractal data&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fractal/angina-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Angina 3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now we see a repeated pattern in our data used for clinical decision making. Not only is our information nested, but we see that there are similarities in our data at different levels of detail. This repeating pattern of data at different levels of our decision making hierarchy is similar to that seen in &lt;em&gt;fractal data&lt;/em&gt;. In essence, a combination of measurements (data) are used to identify a hidden (latent) trait that itself is difficult to measure to inform a clinical reasoning process. The end-result of that clinical reasoning may be itself used in future clinical reasoning. This highlights the naturally &lt;em&gt;recursive&lt;/em&gt; nature of medical information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, an understanding of the hierarchical nature of clinical decision making allows us to consider the considerable redundancy and correlations seen between different covariates; for instance both having a drug-eluting coronary stent placed in 2014 and a diagnosis of unstable angina both flag an underlying (more difficult to measure) latent trait, namely that of arteriosclerotic coronary artery disease. Those characteristics are therefore highly correlated and may be redundant in a single patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;decision-making---by-humans-and-by-machines&quot;&gt;Decision making - by humans and by machines&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Redundancy and latent traits are important when we consider what information needs to be made available at the time of a clinical decision. How do we make sense of large volumes of hierarchical, highly correlated fractal-type data and decide what needs to be seen by a clinician in a particular clinical scenario, or indeed what needs to be used by a machine to learn to appropriately make a diagnosis or decide on a treatment plan? We cannot show or indeed use all information, and not all information is in fact useful at any particular clinical context. As such, we should be considering techniques to reduce the redundant dimensions that exist within healthcare data. For data mining and “big data” processing, we should be exploring dimensionality reduction techniques in order to make sense of an overload of redundant medical information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, we need clinical systems to appropriately model the clinical decision making process and understand that there is no single “truth” but a chain of clinical reasoning at a given point in time that should take into account any and all variables that influence the results of a clinical decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, this is where machine learning and more general purpose artificial intelligence can most help us in our day-to-day clinical work. We need tools to help us understand what our measurements, our data, actually mean and how, in combination, they hide latent variables that should truly determine our next clinical decision. Our knowledge of this fractal-type pattern of clinical decision making should inform how we can generate training data for machine learning and apply those algorithms in the real-world. We should be aiming to replace our informal human heuristics, those short-cuts we use to permit decision-making at a time of significant uncertainty and instead build a data-driven approach to clinical reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now have access to sufficient computing power to allow machine supported clinical decision making but those algorithms need to be trained. As such, we must study and understand clinical decision making, adequately model both clinical data and clinical reasoning and make those data available for machine learning so we can build the next generation of tools to improve medical care for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The term “fractal” was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal&quot;&gt;coined by Mandelbrot&lt;/a&gt; who “based it on the Latin frāctus meaning ‘broken’ or ‘fractured’, and used it to extend the concept of theoretical fractional dimensions to geometric patterns in nature.” I’ve therefore titled this blog post the broken medical record for two different reasons: 1) medical records are broken and fragmented in the truest sense of the word, 2) they have similarities to fractal data as they are deeply hierarchical and nested with clinical reasoning built upon chains of previous reasoning (e.g. a process of clinical reasoning takes place in order to order an investigation, the radiologist reporting the scan performs her own reasoning based on the referral and the actual imaging, a receiving clinician repeats the process now integrating all of those chains of reasoning).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I want to discuss the fundamental importance of data in clinical medicine and the overlap between direct care, service management and improvement and clinical research. The overlap and relationships between these three are shown in this schematic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cis_design/data_pipelines.png&quot; alt=&quot;Data Pipelines&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In clinical research, we have relatively small numbers of individuals with highly detailed information (“high level phenotypic data”). In day-to-day clinical practice, we have large numbers of patients with patchy or low level clinical data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common theme that runs through this blog is, I hope, that the &lt;a href=&quot;/cis-design/2017/05/01/medical-record.html&quot;&gt;medical record defines our clinical practice&lt;/a&gt;, and the foundation of that medical record is usable data… usable &lt;em&gt;information&lt;/em&gt;.  We use that information for direct care of individual patients, organising our services to support the care of groups of patients and to perform clinical research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;creating-a-data-driven-culture&quot;&gt;Creating a data-driven culture&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2005 I started using R (The R Project for Statistical Computing) for my statistical analysis during my doctorate. I’d been disappointed with SPSS and its point and click user interface and crude scripting language. As a researcher, I realised that I would need to run and re-run many different analyses and remembering how to transform and clean-up in preparation for configuring and then running different types of statistical test was going to be difficult and time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote about R on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.medicalnerds.com/10-pieces-of-free-software-every-doctor-should-havean-introduction-to-r/&quot;&gt;old blog in 2007&lt;/a&gt; and since then, I have managed to convince many colleagues to adopt it for their own research. In 2005, I didn’t know anyone else using R (except the R-help mailing list) but it was immediately appealing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it is a programming language, an environment for statistical computing and not simply an application to run statistical tests&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it results in reproducibility. I can run the same analyses over and over again, for example when my data are updated&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it is open-source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My own research involved clinical epidemiology, phenotype-genotype correlations, clinical genetics and psychometrics and, if you are very keen (and want to know a bit more about ataxia), you can &lt;a href=&quot;/images/wardle-2009-thesis.pdf&quot;&gt;read my thesis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;deep-phenotyping&quot;&gt;Deep phenotyping&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a junior researcher, I quickly learnt the value of “deep phenotyping”, the importance of systematically recording the longitudinal morphology of disease for individual patients, aggregating those data for groups of similar patients and understanding the cohort by the use of those data. To do this, one needs to consider the hypotheses and ensure that the appropriate clinical data is captured and recorded in a format that allows those hypotheses to be tested. My project looked at clinical progression, rating scales, the use of wearables and genetics with the combination of different sources of data to make logical inferences about these patient groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinical research requires compromise, intuition and judgement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how much data should be collected?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what will be important?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what can be collected in the timeframe?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how many patients do I need to assess in order to reach a valid conclusion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how will I record that data and in what format so that it is practical for storage, retrieval and analysis?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on, we generated lots of ideas. For example, I gave up on the wearables project when we realised that patients were recording 0 steps in 24 hours, that the devices were too cumbersome and so were being left on the shelf rather than being worn. In those days, the technology was such that the wearable wasn’t actually very wearable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might have already concluded, none of these questions are unique to the specific neurological conditions I was interested in at the same and in fact are generic and widely applicable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;building-analytics&quot;&gt;Building analytics&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I built an analytics pipeline in which clinical and genetic data were extracted, cleaned up and transformed and analysed. This combined a database and used R to do the rest, generating analyses and charts based on those data. With Sweave, I combined those results into reports, clinical papers and eventually my thesis by linking R and LaTeX:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;We identified \Sexpr{nrow(subset(cl, excluded==F))} patients with a reported history of 
cerebellar ataxia between 1999 and 2007 in South East Wales.
Applying inclusion and exclusion criteria as described above resulted in a subset of 
\Sexpr{cf.loca$total} with chronic progressive \ac{loca} with no identified aetiology 
as a denominator population for study. There were \Sexpr{cf.loca$num.familial} 
(\Sexpr{nrow(subset(loca, fh==T &amp;amp; sex=='Male'))} male, 
\Sexpr{nrow(subset(loca, fh==T &amp;amp; sex=='Female'))} female)
familial cases segregating in \Sexpr{cf.loca$num.families} kindreds 
and \Sexpr{cf.loca$num.sporadic} 
(\Sexpr{nrow(subset(loca, fh==F &amp;amp; sex=='Male'))} male, 
\Sexpr{nrow(subset(loca, fh==F &amp;amp; sex=='Female'))} female)
sporadic patients.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When run, this would output the following text:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;We identified 401 patients with a reported history of cerebellar ataxia between 1999 
and 2007 in South East Wales. Applying inclusion and exclusion criteria as described 
above resulted in a subset of 178 with chronic progressive LOCA with no identified 
aetiology as a denominator population for study. There were 55 (26 male, 29 female) 
familial cases segregating in 38 kindreds and 123 (79 male, 44 female) sporadic patients.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course, much more sophisticated analyses were possible, including the dynamic generation of charts, maps and statistics. For example, this chart is dynamically generated from our data source&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/data-driven/sca-prevalence.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sca Prevalence&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;generated using the following code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;\begin{figure}[!tb]

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sp.sca.prev() function source code is &lt;a href=&quot;/images/data-driven/sp-sca-prev.R&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, all of my papers and my thesis were built automatically whenever I wanted, simply by running &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; that would run a series of steps in a &lt;a href=&quot;/images/data-driven/Makefile&quot;&gt;Makefile&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, I could identify any obvious errors in data entry quickly and ensure they were fixed as well as build analyses based on interim data with the confidence that they could be run again and again as data were added. I did all the work in LaTeX, R and used subversion as a version control system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;so-what-different-lenses-same-data&quot;&gt;So what? Different lenses, same data&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been discussing data warehouses, data lakes and analytic pipelines within NHS Wales. Some of us are pushing for an “open platform” based on a foundation of structured data recorded in using open standards and integrating a range of new and legacy services and systems via an API-approach (API - application programming interface) while others think we should be getting on with developing applications and thinking about interoperability later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My clinical colleagues want the right information about the patient in front of them, irrespective of organisational boundaries, so that clinical information recorded by other teams in different organisations, or even in different countries, is available at the point-of-care. We are overloaded by information, and this will increase (particularly given recent and ongoing &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/07/07/disruptive-influences-health.html&quot;&gt;disruptive influences&lt;/a&gt;) so we need the right tools to make sense of that information. Presently, much of the administrative data is computerised but most clinical data exists only on paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My more senior clinical and managerial colleagues want to understand more about how our services perform and how can they be improved. They want to aggregate individual patient data and prepare data to inform decisions across our organisations and need to feed much of that information to other authorities as part of central returns. As only administrative data are routinely digitised, most analytics are focused on administrative matters, so we might &lt;a href=&quot;http://wardle.org/clinical-informatics/2017/06/06/using-data-patient-safety.html&quot;&gt;know how many people were seen, but not really have an idea as to why&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My academic colleagues want to recruit patients into clinical research and capture data in a much more systematic and structured way and use that information to study and publish and inform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to all three requirements is, of course, &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we may need to include much more detail for our research projects, I cannot stress the importance of the systematic and routine collection of outcome data in normal clinical practice for direct clinical care and management of our services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;adopting-a-data-driven-clinical-practice&quot;&gt;Adopting a data-driven clinical practice&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/08/22/health-data.html&quot;&gt;I wrote previously&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We should be focusing on &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; first, as &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; as the solution to a &lt;em&gt;problem&lt;/em&gt;. Data, structured, understandable, semantically interoperable data are the foundation on which clinical applications and our analytics can run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what was wrong with my research analytics pipeline? Although at the end of it I could run and re-run it and get almost immediate results, my data were not stored in a standardised format and my code can’t easily be picked up and used by others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be done differently: storing structured, informative and useful clinical data recorded by patients and health professionals; combining data from multiple sources to add value to information and creating learning adaptive systems that support our work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example I have used before, in which I present a dashboard on which the important information for a patient with motor neurone disease is aggregated in a single view. The determination as to whether the patient has a gastrostomy (or other kinds nutritional support) is a sequential look at the record of procedures performed (insertions and removal of gastrostomy tubes):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mnd-dashboard.png&quot; alt=&quot;Mnd Dashboard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That dashboard took me about 10 minutes of work to write as all of the important information was already being collected in a sequence of clinical encounters by my colleagues from palliative care, speech and language, dietetics, specialist nurses and neurologists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-power-of-aggregation&quot;&gt;The power of aggregation…&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EDSS is the expanded disability scale score, a relatively easy-to-use scale running from 0 to 10 that is used as a clinical indicator of disability. Health professionals can record it but we can also derive the score directly from patients using my iPad application:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/N3PQ2EEQNt4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following dynamically generated chart shows a single patient’s disease course over time compared to every single other patient we know with multiple sclerosis or a type of that disease:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/edss-graph.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Edss Graph&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The single patient’s course is shown by the red line, with relapses (acute deteriorations) marked with an “R”. The dotted lines are like the centile lines on a baby’s growth chart: from disease onset, the median disability for the whole cohort is shown. At a glance, we can then see whether an individual patient is deteriorating more quickly than expected or is more disabled that their peers and helps us to tailor their treatments appropriately. In patients with aggressive disease, we might choose to use more aggressive treatments with a greater risk of side-effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SQL code that identifies all patients with any type of multiple sclerosis, tracks their progress and aggregates the disability data is &lt;a href=&quot;/images/data-driven/msss-edss.sql&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;iteration&quot;&gt;Iteration&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we don’t stop there. We continue to build statistical models to track disease progression, combining different outcome measures and their proxies to try to understand the disease. As a result, our work will never be done; we can generate new models of disease progression that better predict deterioration and must embed that work into our day-to-day clinical practice. As such, we should aim for a virtuous cycle of continuous improvement, embedding clinical research into our day-to-day clinical practice in a similar way to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isixsigma.com/dictionary/dmaic/&quot;&gt;Six Sigma quality initiative&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cis_design/dmaic.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dmaic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning is a useful addition to our analytics platform. We can already use standard survival analysis to identify the factors that are important in predicting survival and subsequently build a heuristic to help us in our clinical decision making. New technology offers us hope to improve those models and to speed up the iterative cycle to build continuously adaptive and learning systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a schematic representing how I think we need to create an open platform for healthcare in Wales:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/platform/platform-overall.png&quot; alt=&quot;Platform Overall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this schematic, the platform represents a range of APIs providing access to a unified aggregated view of a single patient record, but the other definition of a “platform” is of a multisided market:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, another definition of a “platform” is a set of services that bring together users and providers to form a multisided market. Is it possible then to take our “open platform” and start to think of a future in which we have products and services that actually do enable a re-imagining of healthcare provision to bring together patients, carers, health professionals, commissioners, analytics, researchers and all other stakeholders in a safe and secure manner?  (see &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/08/20/disruptive-influences-future.html&quot;&gt;a previous blog post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, our health platforms, if they exist, are lopsided asymmetric systems in which patients play little or no role. We must start thinking about creating a data-driven architecture that corrects this asymmetry in power and control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all cases, the foundation of that work is data. Technology is the enabler; it can release the value from our data.&lt;/p&gt;

Here is my full response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;should-we-worry-about-big-dataaimachine-learning-in-healthcare&quot;&gt;Should we worry about ‘Big Data’/AI/machine learning in healthcare?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the two main concerns relate to privacy and value: fundamentally, privacy simply relates to the risk to individuals of sharing information about those individuals and value relates to the intrinsic worth of that data as well as the value of any algorithms or software produced as a result of analysis of that data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to explore the privacy concerns without clarifying what we mean by data and how it is already used, particularly as privacy depends fundamentally on the purpose to which the data is processed and by whom. For example, in medical settings, you might expect me as your neurologist to have access to your relevant medical information from other healthcare professionals, such as reports, documents and the results of investigations such as scans and laboratory investigations. Currently, most such data is held by NHS organisations or commercial companies operated for and behalf of those healthcare providers. There are, therefore, already many current situations in which selected data is shared externally with healthcare, social care and commercial entities. Such data are used for direct care of individual patients and for managing our clinical services. Likewise, there are already many situations in which routine NHS data is combined and de-identified in some way and made available for research such as the CPRD (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cprd.com/home/&quot;&gt;https://www.cprd.com/home/&lt;/a&gt;) and SAIL (&lt;a href=&quot;https://saildatabank.com&quot;&gt;https://saildatabank.com&lt;/a&gt;). Such systems usually try to remove obviously identifiable information such as name and date of birth and instead generate categorical variables (e.g. year of birth) to try to obfuscate the identify of individuals. Have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://understandingpatientdata.org.uk/what-does-anonymised-mean&quot;&gt;https://understandingpatientdata.org.uk/what-does-anonymised-mean&lt;/a&gt; in relation to de-identified, anonymous and pseudonymous data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there is not a discontinuity between identifiable and non-identifiable information but instead a spectrum running from low to high risk of re-identification. This risk increases as more and more data are made available and this is where the concept of “big data” results in privacy concerns. You may not be able to identify me from only knowing I’m a neurologist, but if you know I work in Wales and have an interest in information technology then you’re likely to know it’s me. As a result, “big data” in which large amounts of different types of data are made available and aggregated can undermine techniques to de-identify that data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next question is, does sharing identifiable or re-identifiable data matter? In general, the answer depends on who is doing the processing and the consequences, benefits and risks from that processing. People naturally have different expectations for the usage of data depending on whether it is for direct care, for clinical research, for a perceived “greater-good” or for commercial means. The care.data fiasco demonstrated the strong public concern relating to the release of information to commercial such as the insurance industry (e.g. see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/28/care-data-is-in-chaos&quot;&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/28/care-data-is-in-chaos&lt;/a&gt;). Fundamentally therefore, this means that we need strong and appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks to ensure that we take advantage of the enormous opportunities inherent in combining these sources of data with modern technology to improve patient care and clinical research. The new GDPR legislation extends the rights of individuals to control the purposes to which their information is used, and we in healthcare must take these changes into account when considering “big data” and machine learning. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-protection-reform/overview-of-the-gdpr/&quot;&gt;https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-protection-reform/overview-of-the-gdpr/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the issue of “value” depends on who gains that value. If an algorithm is developed that can, for example, screen a chest x-ray to determine whether it is normal or abnormal, with only the latter images needing formal radiologist review, then there would a huge interest across the world in commercialising that technology and free up valuable time for radiologists. Who should own that technology? The services providing the data or the technology companies who have built the systems to learn from that data? For me, this should be a partnership between health and technology as both need each other in order to make progress to potentially improve patient care. As a result, I’d always expect explicit clauses relating to intellectual property rights to be included in data sharing agreements in which software and algorithms may be of commercial value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-other-privacy-protectingenhancing-technologies-are-there&quot;&gt;What other privacy-protecting/enhancing technologies are there?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like “Understanding patient data” : see &lt;a href=&quot;https://understandingpatientdata.org.uk/how-data-kept-safe&quot;&gt;https://understandingpatientdata.org.uk/how-data-kept-safe&lt;/a&gt; and its explanations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, it is necessary to have a mixed set of strategies as there is no single “magic bullet” that magically preserves or enhances privacy.  Instead, we need a combination of appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks (as I mentioned above), independent review and audit, formal software specifications and methodologies and, most importantly, a conversation with everyone about the benefits and risks of the use of patient data to improve care, now and in the future. As part of that national debate, we must determine the scenarios in which different levels of consent are required, such as an explicit opt-in for clinical research or an opt-out for other uses. At the same time, we must increase general public awareness about the benefits and risks of the wider use of health information. Ideally, data should be de-identified as much as possible for the specific use-case in question so that we instead start to talk about “risk of re-identification” and it is likely that different levels of risk will be acceptable for different use-cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are additional technologies to add into the mix such as “differential privacy” (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy&lt;/a&gt; for more information) which introduce randomness into aggregated data in order to reduce the risk of re-identification and yet preserve conclusions made from the use of that data. Another interesting research development has been homomorphic encryption allows information such as private medical data to be encrypted and subsequently processed without needing decryption. Have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption&lt;/a&gt; but such technology is, as far as I am aware, at a very early stage as it is extremely computationally-intensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;are-we-considering-privacy-enough&quot;&gt;Are we considering privacy enough?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably not!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health data becomes even more complex when one considers the ever increasing use of new technologies in healthcare. I have written about these in my “disruptive technologies” blog post (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://wardle.org/clinical-informatics/2017/07/07/disruptive-influences-health.html&quot;&gt;http://wardle.org/clinical-informatics/2017/07/07/disruptive-influences-health.html&lt;/a&gt;) and in particular, how we deal with data from multiple sources such as devices carried by the patient or installed in the home. As a result, there will be an increasing number of &lt;em&gt;“attack surfaces”&lt;/em&gt; in which confidential medical information may be leaked. For instance, how will we deal with the data sent from a device designed to monitor an elderly patient and check for falls, or whether they have left their home, or their activity? How will we ensure that only the right people receive that information?   The same issues apply to medical and health applications aimed at consumers which may leak confidential medical information. There are many examples unfortunately - see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4419898/&quot;&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4419898/&lt;/a&gt;  for just some of the examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A useful resource is the “privacy-by-design” page from the ICO: see &lt;a href=&quot;https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/privacy-by-design/&quot;&gt;https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/privacy-by-design/&lt;/a&gt; in which organisations undertake a privacy impact assessment to reduce potential harm to patients. Such tools are only useful when they are used, so the concept of sandboxes is also important, particularly for mobile device “apps”. For example, on most mobile devices, an application must request permission to access contacts, the camera or onboard health data and checks of those permissions are not a function of the application to implement (or not) but a function instead of the sandbox in which the application runs and all data access can be logged. So I think device manufacturers have a role in checking and verifying applications in their app stores and programmes like NHS digital’s app store (see https://apps.beta.nhs.uk) add an additional layer of inspection and curation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t add much more to what Dame Fiona Caldicott said : &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/national-data-guardian-ndg-statement-on-government-response-to-the-ndg-review&quot;&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/national-data-guardian-ndg-statement-on-government-response-to-the-ndg-review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main conclusion is that there is no single answer but a combination of solutions :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;give people choice,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;engender public trust by
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;appropriate regulatory and legislative frameworks,&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;adopting appropriate technical safeguards and de-identify information at a level that minimises re-identification risk and satisfies the specific requirements for analytics on that occasion,&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;using verifiable logs to ensure access to confidential information is logged and capable of inspection.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medical data is terrifically valuable, powerful and offers tremendous scope to do good, but we also have a great responsibility to protect those data and ensure access is safe, secure and transparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best wishes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chat with nursing, medical or pharmacy staff. Chat with physiotherapists, occupational therapists, managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They all have problems that need to be solved, problems that make carrying out their day-to-day work more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“What would make your job easier?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“What would enable you to provide &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; care?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At their most fundamental, their problems and the solutions to those problems relate to data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may scoff. Oh here he is again, going on about data as the answer to everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why clinical research, such as a clinical trial, used to answer questions such as “Does this treatment work?”, is built on data; carefully acquired, carefully managed and carefully analysed data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a nursing staffing crisis! We should be solving it, with data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to run an audit to see whether our service is performing well. Solve it, with data (and in a computer on not on paper).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to identify that patient not responding to conventional treatments; we want to show them their progress compared to their peers, because we need to have a discussion about more aggressive treatments. Solve it, with data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many nursing staff do we need on &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; ward, with &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; patients, for &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; shift? How can we identify the deteriorating patient? Show the admitting team looking after the patient with muscular weakness that the GP had already checked the acetyl-choline receptor antibodies two weeks ago and the result is already available tonight. How do patients &lt;em&gt;like me&lt;/em&gt; fare after that procedure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;think-big-with-data&quot;&gt;THINK BIG WITH DATA&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now have virtually unlimited computer resources at our disposal, both in terms of storage and computational power. We need to think big and have grand aims. It’s then our job to develop strategies to carefully take advantage of that technology to envisage better ways of working and to iterate our way to achieve those aims. As I mentioned in my &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/08/20/disruptive-influences-future.html&quot;&gt;disruptive influences blog post&lt;/a&gt;, we may change the detail, but not necessarily our direction of travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;we-dont-have-all-of-the-answers-but-we-dont-have-all-of-the-questions-either&quot;&gt;We don’t have all of the answers…. but we don’t have all of the questions either&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key message, and I cannot say this too many times, is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We need to build an infrastructure that explicitly recognises that we don’t have all of the answers, and therefore must support innovation. Such innovation may simply be incremental improvement of existing technology, but also must cope with and embrace the introduction of transformative and disruptive technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote that during &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/03/15/once-for-wales.html&quot;&gt;debates within NHS Wales&lt;/a&gt; about the best way to formulate an information technology strategy. I’m reviewing a “functional requirements” list for a project currently which will end up with a procurement. It is hard work and it brings into sharp focus an important question: how can I know what will happen when our systems finally meet their users?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, we should be focusing on &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; first, as &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; as the solution to a &lt;em&gt;problem&lt;/em&gt;. Data, structured, understandable, semantically interoperable data are the foundation on which clinical applications and our analytics can run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is why you should be learning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;openEHR : &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openehr.org&quot;&gt;www.openehr.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HL7 FHIR &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html&quot;&gt;https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SNOMED-CT &lt;a href=&quot;/cis-design/2017/05/02/data-standards.html&quot;&gt;see my introduction&lt;/a&gt; or a paper relating to how I &lt;a href=&quot;http://m.futurehospital.rcpjournal.org/content/4/2/126.full.pdf&quot;&gt;implemented SNOMED-CT in a clinical system in the Future Hospital Journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And start thinking about immutable, structured and understandable data stored in vendor-neutral archives or exposed using an open application programming interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for homework, start thinking about how you might create an infrastructure for real-time analytics… for example, show me some simple survival curves in real-time for patients having emergency surgery for any type of pancreatic surgery in the last 30 days stratified by age, gender and co-morbidities… Or, for that matter, the data that might be needed to solve the nursing staffing allocation problem…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we’re going to make “health information universally accessible and useful”, then let’s get the right information in the first place. After all, there are two words in “information technology”…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Changes in the models of care&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patients as active participants&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘Hospitals without walls’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And subsequently, I tried to &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/07/11/disruptive-influences-current.html&quot;&gt;give an overview of how current strategies used by health services and commercial companies will struggle to meet those disruptions&lt;/a&gt;, principally as a result of a focus on single organisations and enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope to draw these strands together in one place and hopefully provide some important context for some of my other blog posts. In my view, the two planks of work to form the foundation of our work are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An “open decentralised platform” for healthcare made up of multiple standards-based interoperable services and data repositories.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A single distributed logical patient record made up of multiple shards connected with multiple pseudo-identities wrapped in a consent model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, we need the right structures in place to allow us &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/03/09/google-information.html&quot;&gt;“to organise healthcare and patient information and make it universally accessible and useful.”&lt;/a&gt; We need to be much more ambitious and yet plan to iterate to get to that future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;1-open-platforms-in-health&quot;&gt;1. Open platforms in health&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, administrative and clinical information relating to patients must be made more widely available outside of closed networks and across disciplines, services, organisations and sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, we must discuss the “open platform” approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internet is one example of an “open platform”, in which open standards result in an open network in which many different software applications and devices can be connected and exchange information. One important consequence of an “open platform” is its use for applications not originally considered by its designers. For example, TCP/IP, the networking protocol that underpins the Internet handles, in a generic way, the low-level handling of bundles of data (messages) between computer systems. This open technical architecture was used as the foundation of the HTTP protocol, although other protocols such as Gopher were also built using TCP/IP as a foundation. This is an example of a &lt;em&gt;layered architecture&lt;/em&gt; in which an open platform, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/cc958821.aspx&quot;&gt;“Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model”&lt;/a&gt; is made up of multiple layers in which scope and function are well defined. Importantly, each subsequent layer usually provides a higher-level of abstraction from the detail. Low-levels of the OSI platform handle the physical connectivity and nitty-gritty details of networking such as data exchange and acknowledgements of transfer. Higher-levels allow software to ignore these low levels of networking management and simply exchange information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internet has made information of all types universally accessible, useful and searchable and most of us now do this on mobile devices we carry with us all of the time. We now carry around practically unlimited computing resources in our pockets, so why can we not do that in healthcare?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-an-open-platform&quot;&gt;Why an open platform?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does the “open platform” matter in healthcare? I have &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/07/11/disruptive-influences-current.html&quot;&gt;touched on the problems previously&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially, healthcare informatics has been dominated by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a focus on administrative functionality rather than prioritising clinical care and the patient.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;large commercial vendors with closed systems and little or no interoperability.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a focus on the procurement of “products” based on &lt;em&gt;features&lt;/em&gt; on a capital expenditure basis with old-fashioned project plans built using a waterfall methodology with start and completion dates and little or no concept of iterative improvement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;organisations that are hierarchical and autocratic, designed to funnel information upwards and decisions made by those at the top flowing downwards. In essence, such structures have arisen as a result of trying to manage risk; when one considers large multi-million pound procurements, one must attempt to slow down decision making and reduce the risk of a bad decision&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;organisations that are risk-averse and fail slowly like a car crash in slow motion, rather than failing fast and learning from those failures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, how do we create the right structures that lower risk and allow more rapid iterative development?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer that, we must ask… what is our goal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An open platform is simply the foundation for a longer and much more ambitious journey in healthcare information technology. It is so important to have a vision for a future in 5 or 10 years; we are certain to be wrong, but having ambitious goals &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; understanding that we’re going to have to change some of our plans; probably the details of some of the steps used to get there; but we won’t be changing the the direction of travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So… shouldn’t our goal be to provide the right structures and technology to create high-quality, valuable user-centric applications that can help solve clinical problems, with the “user” being a patient or a professional or other worker involved in care. Don’t we want those applications running &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; so that we can start work on the next generation of clinical applications. We want to understand our patients and have ready access to tools that support our teams in providing care for patients. Iteration is the key; we will never be finished and there will always be more to do. How can we enable that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve previously described user-facing applications as ideally being “almost throwaway” in our team meetings here in Wales and such statements have sometimes resulted in looks of incredulity. However, describing applications as “throwaway” simply reflects the following logical chain of reasoning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You say I can write clinical applications are “almost throwaway”?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Therefore, the engineering work must be quite straightforward, because I’m a lazy engineer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;But surely there is a tonne of clever engineering work needed in healthcare, such as managing users, managing access, looking at patients, managing consent, access logs, getting and storing complex medical information and understanding the status of a variety of healthcare resources?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ah! The clever stuff must be already be provided elsewhere!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;So, can you show me the API endpoints and documentation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logical conclusion is therefore that we strive for an open platform in which applications coordinate and leverage multiple services provided within the platform; applications are the conductors for our orchestra of services. I expect some core services that are initially, mainly enterprise-bound, provided by individual organisations so that a single application can be deployed with little change between and across multiple those organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, with time, I’d expect to see a marketplace of increasingly sophisticated “services” that are provided outside of the scope of individual organisations, many provided by commercial vendors, in which sophisticated additional functionality can be made available on a cost per-use basis. Over time, the functionality of “the platform” extends upwards into &lt;em&gt;the cloud&lt;/em&gt; increasingly combining traditional data from organisations with new forms of patient-reported, patient-recorded real-life data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are already seeing the commercialisation of services like that in other sectors, with Google Cloud Functions and Amazon AWS lambda services providing serverless and maintenance free deployment and scaling of discrete pieces of logic. When are we going to do this for healthcare? Who’ll be first to offer a natural language processing API that takes a legacy clinical document and turns it into a structured document together with mapping to SNOMED-CT for £0.0001 per document? &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#snomed&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, I see an “open platform” as stage one of a larger plan, but how do we get started?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-an-open-platform&quot;&gt;What is an open platform?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been discussing strategy at length within NHS Wales and continue to have a fierce debate about the best way of using limited resources in the most valuable way. Perhaps reasonably, there are some who think we should be concentrating our limited resources on a single all-Wales application, the Welsh Clinical  Portal (WCP). I will not cover that debate here, but I feel strongly that a focus on an application is a &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/03/15/once-for-wales.html&quot;&gt;poor way of meeting both present and future challenges&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I hope, instead, to influence the national strategy in favour of a platform approach.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#getting-sacked&quot;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; For example, at the moment, laboratory and radiology investigation results are available only through the WCP application. We currently tightly bind WCP into our commercially procured laboratory management system and make WCP the only way of viewing those data, allowing other applications to open a separate frame in a web browser “stapling” functionality together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my schematic of the architecture of a more “open”  test requesting and results service:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/platform/platform-lab.png&quot; alt=&quot;Platform Lab&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here WCP is but one view on the &lt;em&gt;same data&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;same services&lt;/em&gt;. Unfortunately, there are some people that think that embedding different parts of an application within another at the user-interface level, using technology such as frames is a better approach. Importantly, such an approach does not expose the underlying data and so fails to support the use of those underlying data in any innovative manner and thus fails to appreciate the importance of data analytics for supporting clinical decision making for an individual patient, managing our clinical services for groups of patients or for research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The laboratory information management system (LIMS) is provided by Intersystems (Trakcare) and we should replicate that data source in a vendor-neutral archive (VNA) that is exposed to client software via a standardised application programming interface (API). This abstraction is an important tool in making commercial systems a &lt;em&gt;commodity&lt;/em&gt;. Commoditisation of components of an open platform is a vital step in reducing vendor lock-in and focusing on what is important; our data and its intrinsic value rather than a product. In this schematic, the VNA is represented by the “results archival service”. Now if TrakCare exposed a standardised API, for example using HL7 FHIR, then it may be that API could be used by the service layer. But the important lesson is that &lt;em&gt;it doesn’t matter&lt;/em&gt;, because we’ve abstracted the service. Indeed, the same approach would work if we were trying to provide a unified set of results across multiple laboratories all using different laboratory systems, so long as we built a VNA and carefully managed patient identity between different instances. Indeed, our laboratory colleagues could completely change their systems and our application software &lt;em&gt;does not even need to be aware&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our business logic is codified at the &lt;em&gt;service level&lt;/em&gt; and not the application level and, to manage changes in business processes and clinical need, many of the rules that underpin that business logic should be delegated to a rules engine, which allows business rules to be recorded dynamically in a declarative and not procedural fashion in the language of the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve previously discussed the importance of &lt;em&gt;scope&lt;/em&gt;; starting with our problem and broadening the scope to create generic solutions. However, that doesn’t mean that we have to build everything in one step. Instead, if we get the architecture right at the beginning, we can offer a laboratory test requesting and results service and then extend the platform to also support radiology requesting and reported as well. The schematic shows this evolution, with a FHIR test requesting service acting as a &lt;em&gt;concierge&lt;/em&gt;-type service, taking a request and delegating that request to the appropriate, now private, test service depending on the details of that request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The test requesting / results service would fit into the wider architecture like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/platform/platform-overall.png&quot; alt=&quot;Platform Overall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, a pipeline in which data is extracted, transformed and modelled ready for analytics is critical in ensuring that clinical information is made available at the right time to the right people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This “platform” shows the important components required by clinical applications, such as patient demography, user management (a user directory which for NHS Wales is a large Active Directory), logging and security, laboratory and radiology test requesting and results, clinical documents, structured clinical information including patient outcomes, electronic prescribing and reference data. HL7 FHIR supports presenting all of these types of data and services as a RESTful API already. As a result, legacy services would require either a FHIR facade to wrap and map that existing service or a method to replicate information to a VNA that exposed that information in a standardised way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An application written for such a platform, using FHIR end-points to make use of data and services provided by that platform, can potentially be deployed in any environment which provides similar services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;2-balancing-availability-and-privacy--consent&quot;&gt;2. Balancing availability and privacy = consent!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not difficult to imagine scaling an open platform across multiple organisations and enterprises much like the Internet has scaled so dramatically since its inception with patient data stored encrypted at rest and in transit by those organisations or their proxies and made available to others. The next logical step is to take that information and &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/03/09/google-information.html&quot;&gt;“make it universally accessible and useful.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is an important paradox here: we want to increase information sharing and yet preserving privacy and confidentiality for that health information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, healthcare information technology must consider the use of privacy-enhancing technologies in order to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;allow safe and secure information sharing between multiple organisations, professionals, sectors and the patient&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;give patients the tools required in order to control when and how their information is shared&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;provide a distributed, verifiable infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;support a range of mobile devices used by patients and staff&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;maintain the privacy of both patients and staff when mobile devices are ubiquitous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patients must have trust that their private and confidential information is secure and yet want that same information available when it is required. As a result, information systems and the way that they are connected must be &lt;em&gt;secure-by-design&lt;/em&gt;, with security and transparency built-in as a result of the architecture and networking protocols. Layered upon this infrastructure must be mechanisms to capture patient consent. A &lt;em&gt;private-by-design&lt;/em&gt; networking layer would need to implement and support a range of services including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cross-organisational identity, for both patient and professionals as well as other parties such as carers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;multiple pseudo-identities, in which identity may be obfuscated for a particular use to prevent linkage beyond what is permitted.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;commoditising semantic interoperability and data standards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;decoupling of logical systems, including `patient portals’ so that patients not only can choose a provider themselves but then use that portal to communicate and interact with multiple decentralised services.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;networking that does not leak information as a result of analysis of the traffic within it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;support for innovation, trust and verifiability with `sandboxing’ for health applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my final assertion is that HL7 FHIR is only a component of a wider health informatics strategy. We must consider how to create a &lt;em&gt;single patient record&lt;/em&gt;, with information about a single individual made available at the right time and right place when approved by that individual. Fundamentally, this is predicated upon systems to manage &lt;em&gt;identity and patient consent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do we rely on applications and third-party services to double-check that they have consent or is it possible to build that consent into the architecture itself as part of how applications and services locate and use resources about that patient? I think the best way of handling this is the use of multiple pseudo-identities which can be linked or unlinked into an aggregated view of a &lt;em&gt;single patient record&lt;/em&gt;. In essence, we don’t want to rely on software to have to check whether it can access patient data but instead not even know that data exists or where to find it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, another definition of a “platform” is a set of services that bring together users and providers to form a multisided market. Is it possible then to take our “open platform” and start to think of a future in which we have products and services that actually do enable a re-imagining of healthcare provision to bring together patients, carers, health professionals, commissioners, analytics, researchers and all other stakeholders in a safe and secure manner?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;secure-by-design-sandboxing-services-and-applications&quot;&gt;Secure-by-design: sandboxing services and applications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One practical way of considering the problem is to consider how to permit innovation in a safe and secure way and have successful work quickly scaled out across and between organisations. For example, if a new startup company can create tools to automatically identify and monitor patients on drugs such as methotrexate and ensure that they have the required blood tests, how could such tools be deployed safely with certainty as to how, when and why that information was processed with support for an opt-out should a patient not agree to their information being used for that purpose? Can an infrastructure be created that means such applications can be installed in essentially a `sandbox’ in which its interactions with patient data are controlled and monitored automatically? Could that paradigm scale to support access to health data in a generic fashion?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications running on Apple’s iOS provide a useful analogy. In order to gain access to components of the underlying device and its operating system, such as the camera, the photo archive, location services etc, the application must use the appropriate API which forces explicit user consent. This “sandbox” environment means that an application is prevented from accessing resources to which consent has not been provided and presumably can log each and every attempt should that be required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we do the same for health applications and services? It seems to me that we can create tremendous value from healthcare data - for patients, for health professionals and for society - but the foundation must be to allow that information to be organised in such a way that we can make it “universally accessible and useful” &lt;em&gt;subject to individual consent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I started writing a version of this post back in June, Estonia had just announced its plans for its EU presidency to include the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eu2017.ee/sites/default/files/2017-06/EU2017EE\%20Programme_0.pdf&quot;&gt;cross-border movement of health data for the purposes of treatment, research and innovation and to promote data-based innovation in healthcare&lt;/a&gt;. Creating secure platforms on which such communications can operate would be a pre-requisite for those aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;so-what-next&quot;&gt;So what next?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that there are several important strands of work, most of which require health organisations and technology companies to work together to use technology as an enabler for the transformation of healthcare:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;work together on joint data standards and both technical and semantic interoperability&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;build open platforms to bring together meaningful structured clinical information with data from legacy applications, adopting open standards such as HL7 FHIR and openEHR.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;transform healthcare IT procurement moving away from capital “product”-based procurements to recurring expenditure models based on services ensuring that such procurements are measured against interoperability standards. Procure “products” only when truly contributing to or enabling a larger platform within and potentially between organisations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;break-down hierarchical autocratic organisations, and instead create highly functionally integrated teams combining skills from multiple disciplines who can take responsibility for achieving their goals; similarly, with such teams we should not be afraid of in-house development work when appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;explore ways of turning unstructured information into usable and valuable data to explore clinical phenotypes, identify cohorts and use real-life outcome data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;look to improve the routine real-time use of analytics in healthcare for patient care and service improvement; if we can’t do simple survival curves in real-time for patients having emergency surgery in the last 30 days stratified by age, gender and co-morbidities, then we won’t be able to adopt more sophisticated analytics based on deep learning.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;consider picking niche specialist “vertical” markets such as long-term health conditions, in order to innovate and iterate before taking the lessons learnt to a wider audience.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;take a 5-year (long-term) view and work on applying innovative technology (that probably exists today but just needs combining in interesting ways) into healthcare to support a secure, privacy-enhancing distributed patient record that engenders public and agency trust. I think it has something to do with a high-level abstraction of a distributed patient record, with multiple pseudo-identities bound together by consent with verifiable audit logs and service discovery based on that consent security model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why should a technology company be interested in building such an open platform? Because, like the Internet, it will be an enabler and create value for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three disruptive influences are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Changes in the models of care&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patients as active participants&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘Hospitals without walls’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I discuss the current landscape with healthcare information technology and how current products have evolved to deal with these disruptions as well as their deficiencies. My &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/08/20/disruptive-influences-future.html&quot;&gt;third post discusses an open future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;current-solutions-and-their-problems&quot;&gt;Current solutions and their problems&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of strategies have already been adopted to deal with these disruptive influences:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enterprise-wide clinical information systems hosted by organisations to provide clinical record keeping as well as administrative functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Research portals and registries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patient portals to allow patients to view and contribute to their record -  “personal health records”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patient-facing mobile device applications to allow recruitment into research.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Organisation-by-organisation procurement and data sharing agreements with commercial entities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;monolithic-organisation-specific-systems&quot;&gt;Monolithic organisation-specific systems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computer software deployed within healthcare has traditionally been procured and hosted by the organisation in which it is used. Many health organisations in the United Kingdom (UK) have closed networks in which desktop computers are wired into the network and run a mixture of different types of software with file-based network storage. More recent deployments of electronic patient record (EPR) systems such as Cerner’s Millenium and Epic within the UK have repeated this historic approach centred on an organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such an architecture benefits that organisation in meeting its statutory duty to care for patients, combining administrative and clinical data. In the United States, where these products were designed, that combination permits item-level billing and as a result they are integral to business operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this type of architecture is less suitable for cross-organisational working in which multiple disparate teams of health professionals and the patient collaborate. Such an architecture means that community teams, for example, might need to be registered directly as users on any systems in which data on their may reside to permit interaction with other professionals involved in a patient’s care. As a result, professionals may need to switch between applications in order to view a complete record. Similarly, single organisation-bound systems do not easily support sharing information between organisations so that information relating to a patient presenting as an emergency when on holiday to a different facility may not be readily available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, solutions to cross-organisational working adopt a health-information exchange (HIE) model in which information from multiple organisations, typically within a defined geographical region, exchange information. Commercial companies are now increasingly adopting data standards to try to provide semantic interoperability, and it is likely that their products will transform to a ``platform’’ on which other applications can run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several important initiatives encouraging and supporting semantic and technical interoperability:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apperta foundation: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apperta.org&quot;&gt;http://www.apperta.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;INTEROPen &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.interopen.org&quot;&gt;http://www.interopen.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HL7 FHIR: CareConnect profiles (UK): &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/HL7-UK/CareConnect-profiles&quot;&gt;https://github.com/HL7-UK/CareConnect-profiles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;openEHR: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openehr.org&quot;&gt;http://www.openehr.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SNOMED-CT: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.snomed.org/snomed-ct&quot;&gt;http://www.snomed.org/snomed-ct&lt;/a&gt;, browser: &lt;a href=&quot;http://browser.ihtsdotools.org&quot;&gt;http://browser.ihtsdotools.org&lt;/a&gt;, my blog posts: &lt;a href=&quot;http://wardle.org&quot;&gt;http://wardle.org&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://wardle.org/clinical-informatics/2017/06/02/future-hospital-snomed-ct.html&quot;&gt;http://wardle.org/clinical-informatics/2017/06/02/future-hospital-snomed-ct.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current focus is therefore on increasing interoperability at an organisation level, or between organisations within a defined geographic region (such as the Great North Care Record).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;patient-portals&quot;&gt;Patient portals&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current solution to giving patients access to their records is a secure `patient portal’, or multiple portals providing different functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While `patient portals’ may  allow patients to communicate with their teams, see their results and contribute data to their records, such portals are frequently tied a single organisation or service. For example, Cerner offer a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cerner.com/solutions/hospitals_and_health_systems/patient_portal/?langtype=2057&quot;&gt;proprietary patient portal&lt;/a&gt; which is linked with its own EPR. Even when patient portals are not tied to a single health organisation such as with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patientsknowbest.com&quot;&gt;‘Patients Know Best’ (PKB)&lt;/a&gt; an organisation must have signed up to use that provider in order to allow a patient to interact with them via that portal. In Wales, there is a patient portal available for certain GP surgeries providing functionality for booking appointments but this is not universal and there is a separate portal for the recording of patient reported outcome measures, the results of which are not made available in clinicians. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthwisewales.gov.wales/homepage/&quot;&gt;Healthwise Wales&lt;/a&gt; programme is a separate portal that allows the population of Wales to register for a research project on wellbeing and health, but it does not integrate with or support the enrolment into any other research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the choice of patient portals is by the organisation and not the patient, who may wish to interact with multiple providers of healthcare and flag their interest in multiple research projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, how can a patient interact with all of their disparate health services across multiple organisations? Do we expect our patients to use multiple portals depending on whether they are visiting the Royal Free or the Royal London Hospital?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, patients with specific needs, such as those who do not have a fixed address, or those requiring communication via braille or spoken text, must hope that a single provider supports those needs. What if a patient cannot manage appointments themselves, but has a proxy who needs to be involved in their care, such as a nursing home resident?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;research-portals-and-registries&quot;&gt;Research portals and registries&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinical research has traditionally focused on recording longitudinal patient outcomes in well-defined cohorts of patients recruited as part of observation or interventional trials. As a result, there are now many different research registries which are usually disease or specialty-specific. I have written about the &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/06/06/using-data-patient-safety.html&quot;&gt;disadvantages of registries before&lt;/a&gt;, but essentially they don’t really support clinical practice. The main problems are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there are lots of them, so potentially lots of disparate systems (they are not joined up)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;they are not embedded in day-to-day workflow&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there is sometimes little feedback, result or reward, particularly in any timely manner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;patient-consent&quot;&gt;Patient consent&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current mainstream solution for clinical research is direct recruitment by clinicians in their clinical practice or via advertising in newsletters of third-party charitable organisations. However, technology such as Apple’s ResearchKit provides a simple framework for research teams to build trivial mobile device applications to allow patients to sign up themselves, consent and then take part in any necessary data capture for clinical research. As a result, patients can be recruited in large numbers for a single project. As an example, see the mPower study on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201611&quot;&gt;Parkinson’s disease published in Nature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A limitation of these approaches is that research data are typically collected separately from routinely collected clinical data. Historically, this has not had any significant drawback due to a lack of routinely collected clinical data that would actually be usable for clinical research. However, given the other disruptive changes in healthcare, it is likely that structured longitudinal data will be increasingly available from systematic collection in clinical practice. Much like the failed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/review-of-health-and-care-data-security-and-consent&quot;&gt;‘care.data’ project&lt;/a&gt;, such data would need to be combined with multiple other disparate sources of information and as a result, patients must be given appropriate tools to understand and control the use of their information. Importantly however, a record of consent must take care to not divulge personal information as a result of its existence. Just as in email communications, if information relating to a withdrawal of consent of a patient from a HIV project is made available, then confidential information is leaked. Thus, a patient’s current and historic opt-in or opt-out choices must be made available so those choices can be enforced and yet remain private.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;organisation-by-organisation-procurement-and-data-sharing-agreements&quot;&gt;Organisation-by-organisation procurement and data sharing agreements&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most innovative healthcare information technology solutions must still be procured by organisations and then deployed. As a result, a commercial entity acts on behalf of that health organisation and, if data are transferred, formal data sharing agreements signed. For small and medium sized enterprises, procurement processes are long, complex and expensive and traditionally have favoured larger, more established companies over smaller companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, procuring an established, ‘proven’ solution is perceived as lower in risk than collaborating with a small or medium-sized enterprise in a development partnership. Procurement rules frequently require levels of insurance, financial and regulatory backing that make it more difficult for new enterprises to deploy and scale innovation with the health system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How then to balance innovation and governance? Unfortunately, there are many examples of innovative projects that are closed down as a result of a loss of trust in the governance of private and confidential medical information. For example, the `care.data’ project aimed to combine multiple large scale datasets together across multiple organisations in order to support population health research within England, but controversy resulted in its closure. Similarly, Google DeepMind’s project to provide a smartphone clinical application (Streams) to clinicians at the Royal Free has been mired in controversy with negative press reports and a referral from the National Data Guardian to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and a formal ruling pending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such debacles result in a perception of wrongdoing even if no information was shared inappropriately and risk the deployment of innovative technologies in the future Unfortunately, few commentators note the consequences of &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; deploying modern technology in order to support healthcare or indeed note the gap between where we should be and where we current stand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, existing technology focuses on an organisation, a specialty or a specific project. In essence, the digitisation has followed existing paper-based processes instead of using technology to underpin transforming our healthcare services around the patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have read my other blog posts, you will already know the answers to the problems posed in this and the previous post; we need to focus on a data-driven standards-based “platform” consisting of multiple well-defined services working together to create vendor-neutral archives of immutable clinical information in structured formats. My &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/08/20/disruptive-influences-future.html&quot;&gt;next post&lt;/a&gt; covers the components of this platform in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">In my previous blog post, I discussed three core disruptive influences that must be considered when designing the architecture of clinical information systems.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Disruptive influences in healthcare</title><link href="https://www.wardle.org/clinical-informatics/2017/07/07/disruptive-influences-health.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Disruptive influences in healthcare" /><published>2017-07-07T21:59:00+01:00</published><updated>2017-07-07T21:59:00+01:00</updated><id>https://www.wardle.org/clinical-informatics/2017/07/07/disruptive-influences-health</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.wardle.org/clinical-informatics/2017/07/07/disruptive-influences-health.html">&lt;p&gt;Healthcare has traditionally been conservative in its adoption of new technologies. Many clinicians still routinely use pen and paper to record medical information during a face-to-face encounter with a patient on the ward or in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information technology was first adopted in order to manage the administrative running of hospitals such as appointment scheduling and tracking the location of paper records. Traditionally, there has been a separation of these patient administrative systems (PAS) from clinical systems used by health professionals, even if such systems were available.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#patient-safety&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are a number of transformative and disruptive influences in health that, together with new technology, are driving and will continue to drive new ways of working. I’ve grouped these influences into three broad related categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Changes in the models of care&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patients as active participants&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘Hospitals without walls’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;changes-in-the-models-of-care&quot;&gt;Changes in the models of care&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first group of transformative influences relate to the changing way in which healthcare is provided, primarily as a result of changing working practices, a need for safe and secure channels of communication between the patient and multi-disciplinary teams from different organisations and different sectors and a focus on measures of outcome and not process. Such changes are particularly relevant to an ageing population with individuals living longer with multiple long-term health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;changes-in-how-patients-experience-their-care&quot;&gt;Changes in how patients experience their care&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traditional approach to healthcare is based on face-to-face consultations with a primary care physician in a community-based facility, an outpatient clinic with a specialist in a hospital or an unscheduled or scheduled stay within that hospital for a medical emergency or an elective procedure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a consequence of this model, patients with diabetes mellitus used to be called for specialist outpatient review every 3-months and care would be provided by a fragmented patchwork with little or no overall coordination between services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A modern approach to healthcare requires support for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Management of multiple long-term health conditions requiring multi-disciplinary teamwork, cross-organisation care coordination as well as involvement of non-health partners such as social care and the third-sector when appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shared care between teams with remote monitoring using modern technology.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoidance of ‘information silos’ that would usually result in information not being available at the right time or place for clinical decision making. Information should follow the patient and not be fixed in the organisation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, a patient with diabetes mellitus should now be able to monitor their disease themselves with support from community teams including the general practitioner who can call upon a range of specialist services for specific complications or surveillance. Rather than a patient being screened for retinopathy (a complication of diabetes mellitus) in a clinic by an inexperienced junior doctor, they are called to a dedicated diabetic retinopathy screening programme with retinal photography and the results made available to all others in the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;changes-in-how-we-measure-care&quot;&gt;Changes in how we measure care&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important parallel change has been a focus on health outcomes rather than assessing services according to simply how many patients are seen or how many have a procedure. A focus on outcomes permits services to judge whether an intervention such as a knee replacement, actually improves outcomes in groups of patients with similar characteristics to yours. By analysing aggregated outcomes for groups of patients, we can modify our services to achieve the best outcome for patients and benchmark local services with those from elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing our practice to consider outcomes requires an infrastructure that allows the routine and systematic capture of structured clinical data before and after by both clinicians and patients. Outcomes may be based on questionnaires but can just as easily be other outcomes such as return to work, number of steps walked per day, ability to exercise or managing to live independently in one’s home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;big-data&quot;&gt;“Big data”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, we face a future in which we have ever increasing amounts of data on patients. Information sourced from multiple organisations, increasingly structured outcome data and information from technology worn by the patient or used in the home to monitor progress and health status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genomics is an important additional potential source of “big data”. Genomics provides genotype data which, when linked with phenotypic data (what the patient looks like), allows us to assess genotype-phenotype correlations. Such analysis allows us to understand the causes of disease and the modifiers that affect progression of disease or predict responsiveness to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All such data is sensitive and it is in the &lt;em&gt;linkage&lt;/em&gt; of these datasets that is most important. While all medical information is confidential, it is &lt;em&gt;linkage&lt;/em&gt; that those of us who are interested in protected privacy should focus.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#linkage&quot;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;patients-as-active-participants&quot;&gt;Patients as active participants&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second group of transformative influences relate to a repositioning of a patient from a person unto which &lt;em&gt;care is performed&lt;/em&gt; to an &lt;em&gt;active and involved participant&lt;/em&gt; in their care, controlling their interactions and deciding how and with whom their information should be shared. Such a repositioning is necessary given the changes in models care care outlined above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of this paradigm shift, it becomes necessary to design our information systems around the patient and not our organisations. Instead of fragmented services being run using fragmented software, information technology is needed to support an approach in which the patient is at the centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, patients must be able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;View and contribute to their own records.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Record their aims and objectives as well as their own outcomes for use in monitoring their problems and assessing the efficacy of any intervention.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Communicate with members of their healthcare teams as well as other professionals and volunteers who are involved in their care with those communications forming part of a longitudinal record.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Control how and what information is shared about them, including choosing to share their information for clinical research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;communication-between-patients-and-their-services&quot;&gt;Communication between patients and their services&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government Procurement Service (GPS) has estimated that the NHS in England spends £79 million each year on postal costs. While many patients do try to communicate with their healthcare teams via email, there are several problems that restrict its wider use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Current email is insecure with both content and metadata unencrypted with no way of proving identity. While cryptographic technologies are available, tools for signing and encrypting communications, such as ‘PGP’, are too difficult for most users to use routinely.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Email communications are not usually filed into medical records and so the record is not available to the wider team, unless printed and placed into paper records.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even encrypted email communications leak confidential information by virtue of the metadata required to appropriately route those communications. For example, one can infer a relationship between a patient and the HIV clinic if they regularly communicate with hiv-clinic-cardiff@wales.nhs.uk even if the content of that communication is encrypted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communication may be appointment letters, cancellations, clinical communications but also data from devices such as a video recorded of an epileptic seizure, a step-count from an ambulatory step-monitor or an implantable device monitoring heart rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;consent&quot;&gt;Consent&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patient consent for information sharing may be implicit, in which, consent is assumed until a patient opts out, or explicit, in which a specific opt-in is required before information retrieval or processing can begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, an opt-in model is required for patients to participate in clinical research. It is recognised that patients are keen to be involved in research but wish to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/192572/2900774_InfoGovernance_accv2.pdf&quot;&gt;asked for their consent before their identifiable information is shared&lt;/a&gt;. However, that report also notes that “more could be done to increase awareness of the benefits of research”. As a result, intermediary brokering services are needed to allow patients to signify their interest in clinical research and permit them to subsequently be informed of &lt;em&gt;relevant&lt;/em&gt; research projects without divulging their private information. ‘Research brokers’ should match patients to projects and aim to maximise participation. To enable such functionality, private information such as diagnosis and treatments must be processed but via mechanisms that prevent the inappropriate use of that information for other purposes. A patient who opts-in to receive information about research suitable for them must (i) expect to have their information not used for any other purpose except brokering, and (ii) not be shown projects that are obviously unsuitable for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like Google connects users to advertisers, there is value in brokering connections between patients and researchers. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://wardle.org/clinical-informatics/2017/05/20/using-snomed-ct.html&quot;&gt;use of SNOMED-CT as an ontology&lt;/a&gt; (algorithmically I can understand that ‘multiple sclerosis’ IS-A type of ‘demyelinating disease’ for example) can help to support such connections based on diagnosis, procedure or other facets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While simple brokering requires little more than matching on SNOMED-CT, how can more complex requirements be assessed such as, “patients with JME who have not yet had lamotrigine” -  how can allow a broker permit a third-party to check suitability without divulging identity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;hospitals-without-walls&quot;&gt;Hospitals without walls&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third group of transformative influences relate to the decentralisation and democratisation of healthcare enabled by new technologies. These technologies comprise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increasing availability of personal mobile devices&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increasing capability for smart home monitoring with an ‘internet of things’ in which multiple devices are connected together and combine to provide a unified view of a patient&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New commercial models of care, including advanced analytics, supported clinical decision making with applied machine learning for ‘artificial intelligence’.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mobile-devices-home-monitoring-and-the-internet-of-things&quot;&gt;Mobile devices, home monitoring and the ‘internet of things’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New technology means that patients can now increasingly receive their care and monitoring in their home using a range of medical grade devices. For example, implantable loop recorders can be inserted under the skin and, in the event of a cardiac event, the results sent wirelessly to the healthcare team. In addition, there is increasing acceptance of commodity consumer-grade devices, frequently marketed as fitness devices, in order to gain objective data on health outcomes in order to monitor a disease or to assess the effect of an intervention.  There are parallels with the technology used for video-conferencing in which professional, enterprise-grade devices installed in business are increasingly replaced with consumer-grade devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, there is now consumer-grade technology available to allow patients to obtain ongoing advice and care from a range of professionals from a range of organisations via electronic communication channels such as electronic mail or voice or video calls rather than attending for routine outpatient clinic appointments. Such communications need to be safe and secure, with guarantees about identity at both sides of the communication, with guarantees of non-repudiation and verifiability with an appropriate entry recorded contemporaneously in the medical record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, just as outlined above, data transfers from a patient and their devices to clinical services must be encrypted and be kept private with avoidance of information leakage. As a result, not only must the content of those transfers be encrypted but the metadata needed to describe and route those transfers must be kept private. For example, network traffic analysis may be able to identify all elderly frail patients living alone with dementia in a region simply by looking for specific types of electronic monitoring data streams in a similar way to being able to identify when a person leaves their house by eavesdropping on smart meter data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;innovation-data-sharing-and-analytics&quot;&gt;Innovation, data sharing and analytics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is significant potential benefit to the use of software within healthcare in order to improve outcomes, safety and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such software might provide functionality to improve the care of a single patient, or might work across groups of patients to provide analysis of services and outcomes providing a view for clinicians and managers that combines data from multiple sources. In parallel, clinical users are now expecting to be able to use their own or the organisation’s mobile devices in order to work effectively when on the ward. Such applications support team-working, communication and alerts regarding patients under their care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditional approach has been to bring innovation ‘within the walls’ of health organisations which can work when procuring specific products from vendors in order to perform a specific task. However, this model is less suitable for products which provide services via ‘cloud computing’ in which large-scale computing power may be provided across the network. For example, if a commercial entity provided automated or computer-assisted interpretation of histological slides or radiology imaging to multiple organisations using the results of deep learning, that functionality may be better provided across a network rather than being installed within the server rooms of a health organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the “hospitals-without-walls” trend requires a focus on the network with a mixed economy of core functionality upon which innovative applications can operate in secure sandboxes, in which data access and interactions can be monitored and controlled.&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/08/20/disruptive-influences-future.html&quot;&gt;third post discusses how an open platform might better deal with these disrupting influences in the future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“to organise the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and adapted it to healthcare information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/03/09/google-information.html&quot;&gt;to organise healthcare information and make it universally accessible and useful&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and argued that we should be making healthcare safer by &lt;a href=&quot;/information-governance/2017/03/19/information-governance.html&quot;&gt;running it on rails&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to talk about artificial intelligence and healthcare in relation to measurement, data and decision making. I outlined the &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/05/10/machine-learning.html&quot;&gt;regulatory issues according to the MHRA of the application of AI in healthcare in a prior blog post.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;decision-making&quot;&gt;Decision making&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is information important? At its most fundamental, healthcare is about decision making. As such, I would argue that making the right information available at the right time is critical in reducing the uncertainty around any decision in healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.howtomeasureanything.com&quot;&gt;“How to measure anything” by Douglas Hubbard&lt;/a&gt;. It is not primarily written for healthcare, but instead focuses on how to use measurement to reduce the uncertainty around business decisions with a particular emphasis on the importance of &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; is measured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decision-making in healthcare may be relating to the diagnosis or treatment of an individual patient but just as importantly relates to decision-making for groups of patients when we are making decisions about the design of our healthcare services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Douglas Hubbard:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In business cases, most of the variables have an “information value” at or near zero. But usually at least some variables have an information value that is so high that some deliberate measurement effort is easily justified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In medicine, many of our “measurements” (facts gleaned about how a symptom developed, results of investigations) have very high “information values”. Others have very little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I have regularly argued that we should be routinely recording structured information about our patients including information relating to problems, diagnoses and outcomes. Such data then allows us to make appropriate inferences about our patients such as, how is this patient doing compared to other patients with this condition? In many clinical situations, identifying the patient not behaving as expected is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, many of our current “measurements” in healthcare relate to information easily acquired, rather than measurements of &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt;. Before deciding on measurement, he opines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;What is the decision this measurement is supposed to support?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;What is the definition of the thing being measured in terms of observable consequences?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;How, exactly, does this thing matter to the decision being asked?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;How much do you know about it now (i.e., what is your current level of uncertainty)?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;What is the value of additional information?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are recording information (making measurements) that do not support decision making and that information has no intrinsic worth itself, then why are we asking/examining/performing/assaying/recording it at all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;reducing-uncertainty&quot;&gt;Reducing uncertainty&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if we decide that a measurement is worth doing, do we need to perform that measurement on all patients in order to make appropriate conclusions? The answer of course is no. We saw this in the recent UK general election in which an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/firth/exit-poll-explainer/&quot;&gt;exit poll&lt;/a&gt; correctly predicted the outcome based on sampling a small number of voters (100-200) at each polling station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, decision-making relating to groups of patients, particularly in relation to how we configure services or apply limited resources to populations of patients, does not need measurement of all people within those populations in order to reduce the uncertainty relating to those decisions. Instead, it is reasonable to perform those measurements on a random sample. A random sample is, however, not a sample based on a subgroup of patients who have volunteered to take part. Such a sampling methodology will introduce bias in your results. Instead, sampling should, ideally, be a random sample of individuals&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now these three propositions are outlined in the book (I have reworded them slightly to suit medicine):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We care about measurements because measurements inform uncertain decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For any decision or set of decisions, there are a large combination of things to measure and ways to measure them—but perfect certainty is rarely a realistic option.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Therefore, we need a method to analyse options for reducing uncertainty about decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;using-ai-to-reduce-uncertainty&quot;&gt;Using AI to reduce uncertainty&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In healthcare, we have a problem with information overload. I must manually scroll through laboratory results looking for something relevant, and in the current (nationally-provided) software I have to use, one has to actually click to open each individual result to check what it showed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we can refine our needs to include the importance of displaying the &lt;em&gt;right information at the right time&lt;/em&gt;. In other words, which “measurements” to show at a given time point that will most reduce the uncertainty relating to a decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While machine learning holds the promise for creating tools that can make clinical decisions inferences independently or semi-independently, I would argue that information technology should focus on valuably supporting care by organising and presenting information about patients to patients and clinicians and providing intuitive adaptive tools that allow the systematic recording of clinical information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is considerable hype relating to AI in healthcare, but this risks overlooking concrete and tangible benefits in the short-term to &lt;em&gt;augment&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;support&lt;/em&gt; humans, whether patient or clinician, in healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such goals may sound mundane compared to the future possibilities of machine learning in healthcare, but to clinicians and patients who have spent many years being “information-poor”, the power of having all relevant information available on hand as well as adaptive tools to record that information quickly and efficiently should not be under-estimated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a patient admitted with weakness as an emergency. An acetyl-choline receptor antibody test was requested by the general practitioner four weeks ago before the patient deteriorated quickly. Do you think the admitting team will notice that result sitting in the laboratory? At the moment, it will be left to luck. How can that be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, adaptive, learning, intelligent systems should be able to curate medical information (our “measurements”) in order to reduce uncertainty (in this case, our diagnosis of myasthenia gravis).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could try to manually curate the rules behind adaptive information displays with complex if…then statements, but ML offers scope to learn from clinicians. For example, real-time adaptive systems could learn what clinicians click on in different circumstances, “see” that patients are having repeated blood tests after a surgical procedure and then subsequently “understand” that it is useful to graph them. Like Amazon can suggest other things for you to buy, adaptive displays of information can “learn” to present the right information at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you have multiple sclerosis? Here are your outcomes over time compared to patients like you of the same age:
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/edss-graph.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Edss Graph&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have built that manually, but why can’t machines curate the information for us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;bayesian-logic&quot;&gt;Bayesian logic&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Healthcare professionals regularly use tacit rules to arrive at clinical decisions based on a set heuristics which will include ‘a priori’ knowledge applied to individual patients. For example, if I know Wilson’s disease is rare but treatable, I will attempt to diagnose it more frequently that something rare but untreatable. Likewise, if a condition is common, then I will test for it more frequently. Likewise, no investigation or diagnostic test is foolproof, with false positive and false negative results. &lt;em&gt;Bayesian inference&lt;/em&gt; is a way of adjusting the probability of a hypothesis (eg. my patient has Wilson’s disease) based on a combination of `a priori’ knowledge (e.g. its prevalence) combined with new information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in clinical practice it is difficult to truly understand the significance of new information. Just as we need to make information available, we also need help in deciding whether new information (“measurements”) are relevant to the clinical decision we face. As a result, we need technology to identify ‘a priori’ knowledge and support us in interpreting how new data influences our clinical decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion therefore, AI can valuably support healthcare by making the right information available at the right time, and learning how to present that information in the appropriate way to reduce the uncertainty relating to clinical decisions. In addition, adaptive systems can usefully identify the “measurements” (data) required to further reduce uncertainty, leveraging ‘a priori’ knowledge and appropriately adjusting to an individual scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, we need clinical information systems that enable health professionals and patients to make inferences and support clinical decision making, and AI can and must play a useful role in supporting those systems.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Paper is one of the most hazardous substances in a hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Keeping paper over EHR is like keeping horse and cart for fear of theft of cars.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Software is eating the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two are informal quips from colleagues on Twitter, but as I am going to argue that they are wrong, they shall remain nameless!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of you will recognise the last quote from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460&quot;&gt;Marc Andreeson&lt;/a&gt;. I truly believe that software is critical to the future of healthcare, in supporting both patients and health professionals in their respective roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a professional, I want information systems that support me in my work and facilitate changes in working practices that mean that I can do &lt;em&gt;my job&lt;/em&gt; more effectively and to the greater benefit of my patients. If I have electronic records wherever I am, I can have a consultation at any time, perhaps in person but perhaps not. With paper records, such responsiveness is not possible; who is going to fetch the notes from the archives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a patient, I want information systems that support me and facilitate changes in working practices that mean that I can do &lt;em&gt;my job&lt;/em&gt; more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;paper-isnt-all-bad-it-has-workflow-built-in&quot;&gt;Paper isn’t all bad… it has workflow built-in&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Dear Doctors, Can we stop printing out the electronic discharge summaries from the neurology day unit now that they are available in &lt;em&gt;Welsh Clinical Portal&lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“No. Please keep sending them, as otherwise we won’t know when the patient has been admitted and has had their investigations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very easy to design clinical information systems thinking about how the system will look and work and build a product that will solve the &lt;em&gt;perceived&lt;/em&gt; problem. I have written before about how we need to be careful on &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-design/2017/03/23/scope-framing-clinical-design.html&quot;&gt;framing our problem and scoping the solution to that problem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many hospitals now generate discharge documents electronically. They solve a problem: namely transcribing medications and then creating a discharge document. When a patient is discharged from hospital, a communication should be sent to ensure that the patient’s general practitioner is aware of the admission and what happened. Just like a referral to hospital, it is a handover of care from one team to another made up of a diagnostic synthesis and chain of reasoning supporting those diagnoses including results of relevant investigations together with any procedures or interventions and their complications. We used to hand-write these and then the fourth (illegible) copy would be sent to the general practitioner. Later, and sometimes months later, a team member might dictate a more formal summary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my colleague above, in asking for the electronic notifications to be printed, has identified a missing need that the new electronic discharge system fails to solve: a notification to support his workflow in his ongoing care of the patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;digitisation&quot;&gt;Digitisation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paper is not the most hazardous substance in the hospital; it is a key enabler of many processes and workflows with its use and subsequent benefits not necessarily explicitly understood by outsiders. A benefit of paper is that it allows end-users to rapid prototype a system that support a business workflow when an alternative is either not provided or impedes productivity. In essence, workflows built upon paper were the original “feral” systems until such time that they were replaced with a more formal system or became that system by virtue of its ongoing use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all have these “systems”. My secretary places notes in my in-tray and I process them. It is a workflow, albeit a rudimentary one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pile-of-notes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pile Of Notes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that these “feral systems” may not be acknowledged explicitly during information technology deployments - the workflow may be understood by all who work there but never explicitly expressed - it is tacit knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;software-should-be-eating-healthcare&quot;&gt;Software &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be “eating healthcare”&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have previously written about the &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/03/09/google-information.html&quot;&gt;importance of software in healthcare&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital transformation is more than simply replacing a single paper-based process with an electronic one. Instead, one needs to understand the workflows and processes that are dependent on the process you are examining and ensure that these are included in your design for a clinical information system:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start with data and the structures that will be used to hold that data. Data, particularly in health, will be immutable as it reflects what was done at that timepoint and changes in data should be modelled accordingly. Prefer open standards, adopt published information models and bind appropriate terminologies and data dictionaries so that you can provide semantic interoperability with partner software.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Examine the workflow and processes that are dependent and create explicit process models; there may be many such processes for different services with different perspectives on the same data. Different professionals need different views of the same data. Consider how such models can be flexibly configured at runtime using rule-based engines written in the language of the business, rather than hard-coding processes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Acknowledge that, at its most fundamental, healthcare is about communication. Software that ignores human factors will be doomed in the pit of &lt;a href=&quot;/cis-design/2017/05/02/clinical-modelling.html&quot;&gt;real-life/model mismatch.&lt;/a&gt; Build systems that improve communication between and among the healthcare team. Create shared records but understand there is a difference between notifications and alerts and reading a medical record.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the design of user-interfaces as a useful part of an exploratory process to understand data and workflow, but build a layered architecture with separation of data persistence, business/application logic and user interface. Consider user-facing applications to be minimal, thin-wrappers around more substantial services forming a “platform”, providing different perspectives for different users of the same data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plan user-facing applications for multiple devices, even if you don’t intend to create different versions now so that no-one inadvertently loses separation between business logic and the user interface. Make user interfaces “smart” in the way that they help the user but “stupid” in that they delegate their logic to underlying business services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Today’s conference reinforced my previously held beliefs about the best strategy for healthcare information technology improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the conference, we had a mixture of health professionals and academics, all struggling to do what they need to do. The nursing and care coordinators desperately need tools to support their day-to-day work, managing patients and recording their interactions and communicating with one another. The Motor Neurone Disease Association (MNDA)  want them to use Excel spreadsheets to audit their services for benchmarking and assessment against the NICE guidance. The researchers in the room want a population-based registry in which patient data are recorded to support national history modelling, epidemiological students and subsequently act as a platform for subsequent interventional studies. We heard about researchers collecting patient reported data using paper and pen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pattern recurs again and again and I’ve referenced the three core needs of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;supporting day-to-day clinical care,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;audit and quality improvement and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in my blog posts repeatedly: (eg see my post on &lt;a href=&quot;http://wardle.org/clinical-informatics/2017/06/06/using-data-patient-safety.html&quot;&gt;patient safety&lt;/a&gt;). This approach is not specific to motor neurone disease and is widely applicable. The critical issue is to embed the three processes within the same system so that, for example, a clinician recording research-level detailed phenotypic information about a patient for their area of interest uses the same system as the one that he or she uses to simply record a register of diagnoses. I think of a nested approach in one has small numbers of very well phenotyped patients and large numbers of less well phenotyped patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pyramid-of-data.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pyramid Of Data&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important component of this approach is increasing patient involvement in research. Patients want it but there are impediments such as the time needed to obtain patient consent and the resources needed to perform more detailed clinical evaluations. As such, using technology to support enrolment into clinical research is vital; that is, we must provide tools to obtain consent from large numbers of patients in a way that satisfies the regulatory frameworks in which we work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we are increasingly using patient-reported outcomes and adaptive questionnaires to not only understand how our patients fare but even to shape subsequent clinical consultations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it becomes straightforward to imagine an architecture that will support these needs. Indeed, if built correctly with a generic core, a standardised terminology and bolt-on specialist modules, one could imagine it being a disruptive product, creating a commodity platform. I want to see a future in which the platform becomes an interchangeable commodity with innovation and differentiation occurring at a higher conceptual level of support for medical practice. Rather than simple data collection, our mission must be to imagine a future in which medical practice, which at its most fundamental is about clinical decision making, is supported by the most sophisticated tools possible to improve patient care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mission’s greatest risk is in the continued creation of data silos in which health information is locked away in proprietary systems. The answer is to create an open, extensible platform on which innovation can thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would draw a parallel to the evolution of the Internet. In the early days of computer networking, there were many proprietary networking protocols. The advent of TCP/IP and the creation of an interoperable but layered architecture in which at the highest conceptual layer, lower level details of networking were abstracted has resulted in the thriving interconnected Internet as we know it. Similarly, we need create abstractions of our high level clinical requirements but take into account the complexities and paradoxes required in order to share private confidential medical information safely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;minimally-viable-products&quot;&gt;Minimally viable products&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always liked the concept of minimally viable products (MVP) in which one works to prove a methodology or design by creating a minimal proof-of-concept and running it in the real world&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/minimal-viable-product.png&quot; alt=&quot;Minimal Viable Product&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have built my own electronic patient record system and think it is essentially an MVP for healthcare information technology, although perhaps it has now better regarded as an actual product given it is in-use in live clinical environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, clinicians need solutions that solve their problems, and that will vary depending on their role, their speciality and their particular interests. While clinical practice and research are separate processes, having a single system that supports the collection of clinical and research data in different contexts but as part of the same record has been a powerful and valuable tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it is an NHS-hosted web-based electronic patient record system already in use for 8 years&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it now records 3000 clinical encounters every month by a wide variety of multidisciplinary teams, recording structured clinical information and embedding SNOMED-CT into clinical practice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it links to multiple PAS within different hospitals and sends clinical documents into a document repository&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it allows flexible data collection configured at runtime to support multiple cohorts of patients and the generic and disease-specific outcome measures. As such, it is used widely for multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, metabolic disease, neuromuscular disease, motor neurone disease. It is about to be used for adult cystic fibrosis services.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it uses SNOMED-CT as a lingua franca to allow loose-coupling between components and switch functionality on and off in different clinical circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it provides an Internet-hosted portal for patient reported outcomes and mobile device management&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it has client iPad applications to collect patient reported outcome measures and obtain patient consent using Apple’s ResearchKit software.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it can send alerts if patients lose weight or are admitted to hospital, based on an understanding of defined cohorts for long-term health conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it can generate clinical correspondence automatically from data entered during the day-to-day processes of clinical care&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it acts as a communication hub between different members of the team, with messages linked to the patient record&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m now working on scaling out this suite of products and the underlying data-driven principles of the architecture more generally. My goal is to create an open, semantically interoperable architecture for healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;
