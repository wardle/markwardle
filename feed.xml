&lt;p&gt;There are four core messages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of us working in healthcare are already familiar with a range of quality improvement methodologies -  we see them at work when we discuss our healthcare services - and yet we frequently fail to use those same improvement techniques in our information technology projects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can learn from how technology companies have adopted similar quality improvement methodologies (&lt;em&gt;lean&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;agile&lt;/em&gt;) in their efforts to develop new technology, and use the same approaches to both develop and manage healthcare information technology.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That small, cross-functional teams can be given responsibility for delivering discrete functional components of a wider software architecture, bringing together development, testing and deployment as part of a wider “DevOps” strategy. Increasing adoption of ‘serverless’ technologies is a logical result of this strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That these same approaches can be extended to include our existing quality improvement and research methodologies so that we accelerate the adoption of data-driven value-based healthcare in a virtuous cycle of improvement. We use technology to re-imagine how we deliver healthcare to our citizens, with information technology an enabler of transformation; &lt;em&gt;ownership&lt;/em&gt; is key here with IT and quality improvement going hand-in-hand.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve included some links to resources for further reading at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;healthcare-transformation&quot;&gt;Healthcare transformation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to consider &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; we most effectively use information technology in healthcare so that we do more than simply replace our paper records with electronic equivalents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must think deeply about how we can use technology to &lt;em&gt;transform&lt;/em&gt; how we deliver healthcare to our citizens. We must be ambitious and yet plan to deliver those ambitions incrementally, safely, carefully and within the constraints within which we work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Every industry that is not bringing software to the core of their business will be disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Immelt, CEO and Chairman, General Electric, 2001-2017&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, we need to re-imagine a new technical architecture - an &lt;em&gt;open platform&lt;/em&gt; at its core - built on standards and interoperability. But, we must also go much further than simply talk about technical architectures and drive a change in culture and trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, to deliver IT-enabled healthcare transformation, we need the right:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;open architecture&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cultural ‘norms’&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;technical and information standards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These should underpin our software development and technical operations.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#wtsb&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-cohesive-strategy&quot;&gt;A cohesive strategy&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information technology projects must be ‘owned’ by the organisations delivering care with a focus on quality improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The key to creating a lean enterprise is to enable those doing the work to solve their customers’ problems in a way that is aligned with the strategy of the wider organization. To achieve this, we rely on people being able to make local decisions that are sound at a strategic level—which, in turn, relies critically on the flow of information, including feedback loops.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lean-Enterprise-Performance-Organizations-Innovate/dp/1449368425&quot;&gt;Lean Enterprise, 2015, Jez Humble, Joanne Molesky, and Barry O’Reilly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to defend organisational structures in which ownership of information technology projects is outsourced to an external agency. Such issues of ownership are a fundamental problem when something goes wrong&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#ptsafety&quot;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;;  a safer approach is to make the ownership explicit with a clear purchaser/commissional-provider split in which lines of responsibility are explicit. The health organisation as a whole  must “own” the information technology solutions and take responsibility for any consequences of failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, given that all organisations and businesses are now, in effect, information technology companies (including healthcare organisations), information technology should not be the responsibility of a single department but cut across all internal departments. What changes can be made to the way we deliver healthcare that doesn’t have some need for information technology change?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Historically, the adoption and management of health care IT has been left to an organization’s chief information officer and other technical personnel. This is a mistake. … health care IT is effective only when all members of an organization work to unlock its potential.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“… many health care organizations use IT as a tool to monitor current processes and protocols; what only a small number have done is leverage those same IT systems to see if those processes and protocols can be improved—and if so, to act accordingly.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“… [we need to] embrace [IT] as an instrument to help transform the way they deliver medical care. This will entail prioritizing quality improvement over cost cutting, making data collection easier and better, turning the data into actionable information for clinicians, and forging new operating and business models. We have found that while numerous health care organizations are moving in this direction, the majority are not making the holistic changes needed for transformation.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2017/11/the-it-transformation-health-care-needs&quot;&gt;Harvard Business Review (HBR) The IT Transformation Health Care Needs, Dec 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;so-what-are-our-goals&quot;&gt;So what are our goals?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we make the right decisions about architecture, culture and standards to enable us to use information technology effectively to monitor, improve and transform our health services?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are our goals, given we work in complex, heterogeneous, ever-changing adaptive systems, with a high degree of uncertainty?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At our foundation, we need a high-trust collaborative cross-organisational culture. What culture do you have in your own organisation, or across multiple organisations in your wider health economy? We need a ‘generative’ culture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Pathological organizations are characterized by large amounts of fear and threat. People often hoard information or withhold it for political reasons, or distort it to make themselves look better.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Bureaucratic organizations protect departments. Those in the department want to maintain their “turf,” insist on their own rules, and generally do things by the book—their book.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Generative organizations focus on the mission. How do we accomplish our goal? Everything is subordinated to good performance, to doing what we are supposed to do.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lean-Enterprise-Performance-Organizations-Innovate/dp/1449368425&quot;&gt;Lean Enterprise, 2015, Jez Humble, Joanne Molesky, and Barry O’Reilly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of that culture, we must recognise that we do not have all of the answers and that we must be able to adapt to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easy to fall into a trap of thinking the best way of dealing with uncertainty is building “command-and-control” like structures in which we analyse the work to be done and deliver it by breaking it up into components or projects. It is, unfortunately, naive to think that centralised command-and-control reduces risk in delivering valuable information technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, we must focus our efforts around high-level strategic objectives and then create small cross-functional teams empowered to deliver components of that vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“According to the Principle of Mission, we create alignment not by making a detailed plan of how we achieve our objective but by describing the intent of our mission and communicating why we are undertaking it.The key to the Principle of Mission is to create alignment and enable autonomy by setting out clear, high-level target conditions with an agreed time frame—which gets smaller under conditions of greater uncertainty—and then leaving the details of how to achieve the conditions to teams.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Lean Enterprise, 2015 quoting “The Principles of Product Development Flow” by Donald Reinertsen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I wrote in “The paradox of control”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“There is an important paradox in many health services, including Wales, is that there is a tendency to centralise the day-to-day management and delivery of individual products and yet high-level strategic and prioritisation decisions are decentralised, haphazard and dependant on capital funding with little or no consideration or control as to how those projects will fit into a wider technical healthcare enterprise architecture.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/12/05/enabling-innovation.html&quot;&gt;“A paradox of control”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;balancing-inherent-conflicts&quot;&gt;Balancing inherent conflicts&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to explicitly create a) an architecture, b) a culture and c) appropriate standards that result in overall solutions that are safe and secure and yet at the same time enable innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easy to see how such goals can be in conflict, unless we explicitly mitigate that conflict in how we design and manage that architecture, that culture and those technical standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are just three examples of what appear to such conflicts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;we need software to respond to our changing needs and provide ever increasing value via automation (IT “developments”) while at the same time, we need to provide stable, reliable and secure services (IT “operations”)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;we need local innovation and local decision making but ensure that local developments are not orthogonal to the wider strategic roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;we need to adopt technical and information standards and yet support innovation and flexibility in approach.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such conflicts are magnified if we have the wrong architecture, culture and standards. Similarly, the right architecture, culture and standards can minimise or entirely mitigate these apparently intractable conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to adopt “DevOps”, agility and lean thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;devops&quot;&gt;DevOps&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“DevOps” refers to creating cross-functional teams who break-down the traditional barriers between IT developments and operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern technology companies have seen huge productivity gains from creating small teams to quickly and independently develop, test and deploy software and therefore deliver value at pace. They minimise risk by breaking down work into smaller, less risky units that can evolve independently with only loose-coupling with other components. They combine the development of new functionality with highly automated testing and deployment, often building in “feature switches” which optionally turn specific new functionality on or off depending on runtime configuration for testing in limited real-life environments before more widespread use is permitted. Such teams may deploy multiple versions per day, each deployment small and low risk, dependent on successfully passing automated testing and easily rolled back in the event of problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key is that developers can deploy into potentially multiple production-like test environments with little or no manual effort. Deployment is automated from a technical point-of-view, and, &lt;em&gt;codified&lt;/em&gt;. As a result, testing and deployment are both designed and executed using code or configuration files and is therefore &lt;em&gt;automated&lt;/em&gt;. It is entirely reasonable to delay actual deployment into production until other requirements are met, but that is simply migrating provenly reliable code from&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such an approach is very different to what usually happens in healthcare IT. Those of you who work within the NHS will be familiar with long development cycles, entirely separate teams running the different stages of development, testing, deployment, and maintaining services. The process for creating and deploying new functionality typically requires long test-cycles, user-acceptance tests and then, at some indeterminate time in the future, features are rolled into a high-risk big-bang deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.eu/ekRxYte&quot;&gt;DevOps Handbook&lt;/a&gt; talks about a “downward spiral” in three acts, in which components of a wider architecture become fragile and increasingly difficult to change, building an increasing “technical debt”, of attempting to make changes by cutting corners and never really having time to fix the underlying issues and so adding to that “debt”, and resulting in a situation in which:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“everything becomes just a little more difficult, bit by bit— everybody gets a little busier, work takes a little more time, communications become a little slower, and work queues get a little longer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Our work becomes more tightly-coupled, smaller actions cause bigger failures, and we become more fearful and less tolerant of making changes.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Work requires more communication, coordination, and approvals; teams must wait just a little longer for their dependent work to get done; and our quality keeps getting worse. The wheels begin grinding slower and require more effort to keep turning.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.eu/ekRxYte&quot;&gt;The DevOps Handbook: How to Create World-Class Agility, Reliability, and Security in Technology Organizations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The natural conclusion is that we should aim for &lt;em&gt;continuous integration&lt;/em&gt; (CI) and &lt;em&gt;continuous deployment&lt;/em&gt; (CD), with a focus on splitting up what we need to deliver into manageable chunks to be worked upon semi-autonomously by small, independent, cross-functional teams themselves releasing software frequently and often with the confidence of automated toolchains to support extensive unit, integration and security testing with deployment into production-like environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advent of “serverless” technologies supports and extends “DevOps” principles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Serverless computing allows users to run code without provisioning or managing any underlying system or application infrastructure, and they automatically scale to support increasing or decreasing loads. 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.gartner.com/andrew-lerner/2017/07/21/serverless-is-not-networkless/&quot;&gt;https://blogs.gartner.com/andrew-lerner/2017/07/21/serverless-is-not-networkless/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With “serverless” computing, we no longer need to manage our own infrastructure but instead make use of commodity cloud computing providers who take our code and run, monitor and scale to meet demand automatically. Our IT “operations” work is still needed however, but almost by default, software development is immediately deployable into production-like environments. Operations are still needed in order to orchestrate multiple semi-independent services but technologies such as API gateways can act to provide a unified single point of access to multiple services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;agile&quot;&gt;Agile&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;Agile Manifesto&quot;&gt;“Agile” manifesto&lt;/a&gt; was released in 2001; the key points for the purposes of this post are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;continuous delivery of quality software&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;delivering working software frequently&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;harnessing change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easy to see that “agile” is about culture change and that the consequences of a change in culture are a set of technical solutions such as DevOps and Serverless. Agile is, in effect an enabler of “DevOps”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Instead of large batches of work being processed sequentially through the design/ development value stream and then through the test/ operations value stream (such as when we have a large batch waterfall process or long-lived feature branches), our goal is to have testing and operations happening simultaneously with design/ development, enabling fast flow and high quality. This method succeeds when we work in small batches and build quality into every part of our value stream.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The DevOps Handbook&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;lean-principles-and-six-sigma&quot;&gt;Lean principles and Six Sigma&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While “Lean” was originally created by Toyota to improve productivity and quality, the principles are much more widely applicable to other industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The five &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/manufacturing-design/5-lean-principles-every-should-know&quot;&gt;Lean principles are&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Value: what we want to do or deliver&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Value stream: the steps and processes needed to deliver the ‘value’, removing steps that do not add value&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flow: ensuring that the steps and processes that contribute to ‘value’ flow smoothly with no interruptions, delays or bottlenecks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pull: delivery of value as required ‘just-in-time’&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Perfection: making lean thinking and process improvement part of the culture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, many readers might be more familiar with the Six Sigma methodology, now widely used within healthcare. Six Sigma focuses more on variation and design than flow and waste, but clearly these approaches are complementary and indeed, many now combine the two as “Lean Six Sigma”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have discussed the Six Sigma DMAIC cycle previously when discussing &lt;a href=&quot;/cis-design/2017/05/01/medical-record.html&quot;&gt;“The Medical Record”&lt;/a&gt; and the importance of a data-driven approach to quality improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cis_design/dmaic.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dmaic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;application-to-healthcare&quot;&gt;Application to healthcare&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have a convergence that, at its core, is focused on delivering &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt;. Information technology is critical in our healthcare quality improvement endeavours and we can apply those same endeavours to &lt;em&gt;how we build&lt;/em&gt; our information technology tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is my view that quality improvement, in all its forms (e.g. our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.1000livesplus.wales.nhs.uk/home&quot;&gt;1000 lives campaign in Wales&lt;/a&gt;), and information technology are inextricably linked and mutually beneficial. Quality improvement benefits from good information technology as the latter is fundamental in performance of the “measure”, “analyse” and “improve” steps of a typical DMAIC cycle. Similarly, information technology benefits from applying those same quality improvement methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need a “reset” in NHS Wales when it comes to information technology and I suspect this applies to other health economies as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to embed quality improvement at the heart of our information technology and information technology at the heart of our healthcare, adopt a generative culture and deliver at pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need less command-and-control and more trust and collaboration, with decision-making, clinical and design, based on &lt;em&gt;meaningful data&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Scott Cook, the founder of Intuit, has long advocated building a culture of innovation, encouraging teams to take an experimental approach to product development and exhorting leadership to support them. As he said, “Instead of focusing on the boss’s vote… the emphasis is on getting real people to really behave in real experiments, and basing your decisions on that.” This is the epitome of a scientific approach to product development.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The DevOps Handbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;questions-to-ask&quot;&gt;Questions to ask&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are working in healthcare information technology, particularly if you’re in Wales, ask yourself these questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you have a clear view of your “mission” and yet have sufficient autonomy to create teams to get things done?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you have “can-do” ethos and a culture of trust and collaboration?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you have a track record of delivering valuable products consistently, to time and within budget?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the time interval between development and deployment? Is it measured in hours, days, weeks or months?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Similarly, do you have ready access to production-like test environments to prove, via high-levels of automation, that changes in one system have no untoward effects in another? (Ask questions about test environments and automated checks that our systems are deterministic, both when running independently and when integrated with other systems).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does your team view deployment in the same way as committing code instead of with trepidation, planning and prolonged downtime?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you have robust investigation of failures, with a learning culture and codified tests to ensure such failures are prevented in the future?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you have objective measures of quality improvement, do you routinely collect metrics on user satisfaction, performance, downtime or whatever else needs to improve? Have you adopted a &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/10/19/data-driven.html&quot;&gt;data-driven approach&lt;/a&gt; to informatics and quality improvement?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you have a cadre of professional user-interface designers working across teams to focus on improving your user’s experience in using your software?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because, if you can answer yes to these questions, you are much more likely to be able to…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Move fast and &lt;del&gt;break&lt;/del&gt; fix healthcare…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you want to join me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;wtsb&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;:That’s why I was delighted to be asked to chair the new Welsh Technical Standards Board (WTSB), a new group that will work in partnership with the Welsh Information Standards Board (WISB).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;ptsafety&quot;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;: 3079 “parked” electronic referrals unintentionally unsent by general practitioners in Wales to secondary care services were deemed a “process issue” and not an “IT failure” and resulting investigation was “difficult due to lack of engagement from health boards” as the software supplier “owned” the project to digitise the referral pathways and not the organisations that owned the care pathways involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data-driven healthcare means using data to support and provide health services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personal medical data includes current and past medical problems, past and present treatments and interventions but we also increasingly recognise the value in data derived from personal devices and home monitoring. In addition, we need to take into account more generic medical information such as appropriate guidelines, literature and knowledge support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to support both patients and professionals in finding and making sense of that information in order to support decision-making. Similarly, we need to use these data to care not only for an individual patient but to look across groups of patients to understand outcomes and the effects of our interventions at a population-level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SNOMED CT is a comprehensive healthcare terminology; the UK distribution of SNOMED CT contains over 1,500,000 descriptions of over individual 500,000 concepts comprising problems, symptoms, signs, diagnoses, medications (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/pharmacies-gp-practices-and-appliance-contractors/dictionary-medicines-and-devices-dmd&quot;&gt;dm+d&lt;/a&gt;) and procedures as well as supporting administrative concepts such as occupations, countries of birth and many others. SNOMED CT has been derived, in part, from the UK Read codes, widely used in general practice, but importantly, while Read codes provide only a single hierarchy, SNOMED CT supports the definition of multiple types of relationship between concepts. The most frequently used relationship, IS-A, provides a taxonomic hierarchy in which specific concepts, such as “myocardial infarction” are classified as a member of a higher class, such as “ischaemic heart disease” or “disorder of the heart”. As a result, SNOMED CT provides a medical ontology that is meaningful to professionals and is computable; I have previously demonstrated my own electronic patient record software that, using code, can systematically identify patients with a certain disease and highlight important outcome measures and compare disease progression with peers in conditions like motor neurone disease and multiple sclerosis (see &lt;a href=&quot;/patientcare/2018/02/19/so-I-built-an-EPR.html&quot;&gt;“so I built an EPR”&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While its size means that it is often very comprehensive, SNOMED CT can be difficult to implement technically and much effort is required to manage the quality of concepts and the relationships between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, one of the ways of managing the complexity has been to set up a working group of interested clinicians in order to define a reference set of  curated terms in order to simplify the implementation for specific clinical workflows. Indeed, there are now over 250 reference sets in the UK distribution alone. Some of these, such as language reference sets, are now an essential part of the SNOMED CT model as they provide the data to support logic on which preferred synonym to use for a particular language or dialect. However, some simply provide a restricted list of concepts to aid implementation, user interface design and analysis for a specific clinical context or subspecialty. For instance, we now have a UK emergency care diagnosis reference set containing 770 clinical diagnoses that are thought to be useful in an emergency department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to argue that,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we should be spending our time as a community improving the quality of the concepts and relationships in the core SNOMED CT model in preference to thinking we should start by creating a new reference set that will need ongoing maintenance and curation; why unnecessarily limit choice? We can permit access to end-users the whole of SNOMED CT by making use of the taxonomic hierarchy to limit choice in a specific context as long as you design an appropriate user interface; we can limit choice to types of “countries of birth” for a country of birth data entry field and “diagnoses” for a diagnosis data entry field but why constrain only to a subset of diagnoses? The only use of optional constraints is to make it easier for the user to enter commonly used terms, and there are probably better ways of learning those that starting a new committee, such as tracking terms automatically and learning on-the-fly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we can support analytics by using that taxonomic hierarchy to simplify and make sense of raw data; in essence, to reduce complex high-dimensionality data into something simpler and computable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My final point is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we need to build open-source tools to build an infrastructure that can act as a platform onto which more innovation, including the application of machine learning, can be built. We need to make this core functionality a commodity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;using-snomed-ct-in-real-life&quot;&gt;Using SNOMED CT in real-life&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I embedded SNOMED-CT into an &lt;a href=&quot;http://m.futurehospital.rcpjournal.org/content/4/2/126.full.pdf&quot;&gt;electronic patient record system in 2009&lt;/a&gt; and have used it since as the lingua-franca in handling semantic interoperability and appropriate isolation between modules of the application. An article briefly describing its functionality is available &lt;a href=&quot;http://m.futurehospital.rcpjournal.org/content/4/2/126&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three important learning points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it is possible to implement SNOMED CT and make it accessible to users&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in my experience, you know you have good user interface design when your users do not actually know that they are using SNOMED CT&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the use of SNOMED CT does not mean you enter terms only by direct user entry such as an autocomplete textfield  or drop-down selections. SNOMED terms can be imputed as a result of other processes and as such, it can be used as an intermediary structure onto which to build clinical decision support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a user entering a country of birth:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/so-i-wrote/background.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Background&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this diagram, the user has no idea that they are entering SNOMED CT concepts, but their choice is constrained appropriately so that they cannot enter a diagnosis in a country of birth field and we can understand that being born in France means that a patient was born in Europe. I’ve obviously not hard-coded this logic, I’ve simply configured my user interface control to allow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;selection of a commonly selected concept in this specific context, such as a particular type of clinical setting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an ability to search for less frequently used concepts with a simple autocomplete search - the “Other…” link opens this link when the user wishes to select a term not in the most-frequently used pop-up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;constraint of both to the appropriate context, in this case, countries of birth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I type MI and can readily select the diagnosis I wanted, in this case “myocardial infarction”. This is from a simple demo application rather than a proper electronic health record:
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/so-i-wrote/snomed-search.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Snomed Search&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use the same approach to simplify building clinical forms for data entry, with SNOMED CT terms either entered by the user:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cppjedy-hMo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or imputed based on logic from other data entered, such as “able to walk” based on entry of a disease-specific structured disability rating scale. Other modules do not need to ‘understand’ the disease-specific scale but use the intermediary SNOMED based data structures to make appropriate inferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you give tools to professionals that make it easier to enter coded structured information than free-text, they will do so. Coding diagnoses, procedures and background information is critical in understanding outcome data; they are a foundation on which more complex and sophisticated analytics can be built, particularly if you ensure that those analytics are immediately available to support clinical decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;analytics&quot;&gt;Analytics&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the point of collecting data if we don’t use them to support our clinical care? We must make data that is &lt;em&gt;computable&lt;/em&gt;, that is, to be processed and analysed so it is useful for decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computer-intensive analytics, just like more conventional statistic approaches, can struggle with high-dimensional data. Much of our work in data analytics is cleaning data in order to make it computable. In conventional linear modelling for example, we might hypothesise that a range of covariates, a range of factors, might influence an outcome measurement and so we might estimate that we will need a sample size of 3-20x the number of variables. However, determination of sample size is much more complex than that, needing to take into account effect size and degrees of freedom for each covariate in our regression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are our options here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let me enter free-text&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask me to record, manually, a general categorical data-entry instead of a specific concept.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let me choose from a limited number of “choice” options.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Record the best, most specific concept at the time of data-entry that matches what I’m thinking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, we might have a referral pathway that  uses free-text which makes it possible for human consumption when processing individual referrals but difficult to compute, aggregate or make sense when examining many thousands of referrals to understand demands on our services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, we could ask the referring professional to simply choose a type of referral, such as “ischaemic heart disease” or “valvular heart disease” so that the referral can be redirected to the appropriate subspecialty cardiac service. This limits what we collect so that it becomes easier to process, both for human consumption and for analytic purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are problems with this approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Categorisation needs to be done prospectively.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We deliberately lose specific information in favour of recording a general category only.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It adds an additional step for users.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If we change our categorisation because of changes in our service, we have to change what the users have to choose and subsequently deal with handling analytics before and after the change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the best approach is to preserve the granularity, the specificity, of the clinical concept(s) chosen at source and permit arbitrary categorisation at a later date, depending on need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;open-source-tooling&quot;&gt;Open source tooling&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have released two open-source SNOMED CT terminology servers which support both the fast free-text search of SNOMED CT concepts as well as support for analytics and generalisation of specific SNOMED concepts into more general broad diagnoses or categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wardle/rsterminology&quot;&gt;rsterminology&lt;/a&gt; has its roots in 2007-2008 and used to be a module within a larger application; it is now a java microservice built using &lt;a href=&quot;Apache Cayenne&quot;&gt;Apache Cayenne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bootique.io/&quot;&gt;Bootique&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://linkrest.io/&quot;&gt;LinkRest&lt;/a&gt;. It supports SNOMED distributions in the RF1 release format, which is now deprecated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wardle/go-terminology&quot;&gt;go-terminology&lt;/a&gt; is a new golang command-line tool and microservice whose main focus is in supporting analytics. It supports SNOMED RF2, the current release format. It is a work-in-progress but usable now. It is my first golang application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;obtaining-simple-information-about-a-concept&quot;&gt;Obtaining simple information about a concept&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using either web service, we can readily obtain information about a concept, including the preferred synonym for a particular locale, here British English, and simplified subsumption testing, showing all of the IS-A relationships for this concept walking all of the possible paths up to root.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, we see that multiple sclerosis (24700007) is a type of demyelinating central nervous system disease (6118003) and a type of neurological disease (118940003)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/snomed/ms-concept.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Ms Concept&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;genericise-a-concept&quot;&gt;Genericise a concept&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genericising a concept finds the best equivalent match for a specified concept either from a manually chosen list of categories or from an existing refset. This requires the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wardle/go-terminology&quot;&gt;go-terminology service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, here we take a chosen concept, multiple sclerosis, and map it to the curated UK emergency care diagnosis reference set (991411000000109):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/snomed/ms-to-eu-refset.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Ms To Eu Refset&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might expect, multiple sclerosis is in that refset, so the service simply returns it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a rare disorder like acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM - 83942000) is not a member of the UK emergency diagnosis reference set. Can we genericise this to make it useful for our analytics? Indeed we can, and using the SNOMED hierarchy, we can determine that ADEM is a type of encephalitis and automatically return that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/snomed/adem-to-eu.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Adem To Eu&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that adequate genericisation needs to identify the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; match and not just any match as otherwise, ADEM might simply be classified as a neurological disorder; while true, a more specific match exists in that reference set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, here we ask to genericise “myocardial infarction” (22298006) to one of four broad categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Neurological disorder (118940003)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Heart disease (56265001)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ischaemic heart disease (414545008)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Heart valve stenosis (44241007)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple subsumption test would indicate that myocardial infarction could be any of the three latter categories, so what result do we get?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/snomed/mi-to-category.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Mi To Category&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appropriately, the service maps to ischaemic heart disease as the closest best match of the four categories available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, aortic stenosis is appropriately mapped to a type of heart valve stenosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/snomed/as-to-category.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;As To Category&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have successfully deployed SNOMED CT in real-life clinical environments since 2009, with almost all users entirely unaware that they were using SNOMED CT. I would argue that it is possible to safely permit access to all concepts with limits only on the basis of the taxonomic hierarchy and not on the basis of reference sets. I do limit the initial pop-up list to concepts most frequently used in a specific clinical context and might consider using an existing reference set as a starting list for those. While reference sets are now vital for some functionality, such as supporting localisation, I am sometimes disapppointed by what appears to be the default initial thoughts of working groups and committees, on starting to consider SNOMED CT implementation, to think about defining a new reference set for their purposes. Instead, we should improve the quality of the overall product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decision support, analytics and benchmarking our services to others, we can use the taxonomic hierarchy to “understand” the specific concepts entered by our users, mapping them to higher level, broad concepts; we need simple tools to process and simplify structured clinical information, made available to multiple data processing pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to create an open-source foundation of services with which to build the next generation of advanced and valuable clinical information systems. We need to make an open and free infrastructure on which we create value, adopting open-source and building communities in order to create a &lt;em&gt;commodity platform&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this end, I hope to continue to build these open-source tools to support complex data transformation and simplification and would be keen to get collaborators who wish to do the same. Much of the go-terminology tool is to support the work I outlined in &lt;a href=&quot;/machine-learning/2017/12/17/diagnostic-inference.html&quot;&gt;my diagnostic inference blog post&lt;/a&gt;), particularly the need for dimensionality reduction in machine learning. Let me know if you want to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we consider how we can most effectively use digital technology in healthcare, It is easy to fall into a trap and simply support existing models and processes of care. Instead, we must raise our ambitions and look to digital technology to enable new ways to transform our health services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we mustn’t only limit our transformation agenda to only using digital channels to enable new ways of delivering care either. Fundamentally, we should be looking to digital tools to improve healthcare to provide &lt;em&gt;better outcomes for the populations that we serve&lt;/em&gt;. It is easy to lose sight of this ultimate aim: &lt;em&gt;outcomes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, we need to embed &lt;em&gt;digital thinking&lt;/em&gt; across all facets of our health services; digital is more than simply using technology but broad-based fundamental change which, at its core, means we focus on the data to become &lt;em&gt;data-driven&lt;/em&gt;, and what are we driven to do? We must be driven to improve outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means we need to create structured, meaningful data that will provide the foundation on which we create added value. Meaningful data means data that can be used for making decisions, reducing the uncertainty inherent in any decision. That decision may be whether to recommend a particular treatment for a specific patient, it might decide where your emergency medical team needs to intervene with a deteriorating patient on a ward in a hospital but it might also be used to inform us how and why we need to reconfigure or restructure our health services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, our healthcare digital transformation agenda must, like many other enterprises, invest in data analytical capability and, consequently, in computing power to help us store, retrieve and make sense of burgeoning amounts of data. We must make data the bedrock of our health enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, healthcare has always used data to inform practice. This is the basis of evidence-based medicine, but the cycle of clinical research from data collection, analysis, intervention and assessment can be too slow and usually, data collection has been designed specifically for that trial in a carefully selected population of patients. We use a similar approach with service transformation and quality improvement but fully embracing digital should mean that we improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our quality improvement interventions and embed those process in day-to-day care; the important difference is the use of systematically and routinely collected real-life data on process and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cis_design/dmaic.png&quot; alt=&quot;Quality improvement lifecycle - define, measure, analyse, improve, control&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, such analytics should run in real-time, providing us continuously updated information about the patients and services for whom we care. The logical conclusion is that we will see a convergence of ‘business analytics’ with our electronic health records built on a single source of “truth”: meaningful data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do we enable data-driven digital transformation? In my view, it is with open data standards, open application programming interfaces and citizen engagement with transparency and control over the use of data. Together, those pieces fit together to form a ‘platform’ onto which other valuable services and applications can be built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open data standards, open protocols and open application programming interfaces are powerful disruptive technological advances which cause creative disruptive and commodification in an industry. We are about to see the result of this in healthcare. But what is creative destruction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;creative-destruction&quot;&gt;Creative destruction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is useful to examine how ‘value’ in technological terms evolves over the years as it helps to understand and perhaps predict what might happen in the coming years. To do so, we must look at how new technology has evolved and disrupted the technological advances of the previous generation as part of a continuous cycle of &lt;em&gt;creative destruction&lt;/em&gt; and commodification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A commodity refers to goods or services which have value but are &lt;em&gt;fungible&lt;/em&gt;; that is, it doesn’t really matter who produces or provides that commodity, essentially they are interchangeable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In software, the creative destruction cycle can result in the commodification of technology. For example, historically, computing networking protocols were proprietary resulting in networking that was both expensive and incompatible with other proprietary network systems. The open networking protocol (TCP/IP) has disrupted the marketplace for proprietary networking; we now regard networking as a commodity on which most of our modern information technology solutions are built. Networking itself has permitted worldwide communication and collaboration permitting new ways of working, new approaches to distributed software development and ‘open source’ technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the world’s most valuable companies have arisen due to near ubiquitous personal networking; commoditisation can create a new market far larger than that achieved than when the same technology was proprietary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current software technology such as cloud computing, in which applications and services can be provisioned and scaled on demand by a hosting provider, are the end result of this continuous cycle of innovation and commoditisation. Indeed, with container and serverless technology, we see the hosting providers becoming increasingly fungible. But what do these providers gain from making their services a commodity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;so-where-is-the-value&quot;&gt;So where is the ‘value’?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; in creative destruction and commoditisation derives from building valuable innovative products in the new markets created by those processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As cloud computing becomes more ubiquitous, healthcare enterprises will increasingly switch away from purchasing and installed software locally and instead make use of software-as-a-service. We can see the beginnings of this in non-health markets already with the advent of marketplaces like &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/&quot;&gt;Amazon’s Serverless Application Repository&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/monetize-your-apis-in-aws-marketplace-using-api-gateway/&quot;&gt;AWS Marketplace / API gateway&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for healthcare information technology? What will happen if as we build open systems, open standards and open application programming interfaces creating an &lt;em&gt;open platform&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will see a commodification of that platform and we will enable an ecosystem of innovation products that can use that platform to add value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, another definition of a “platform” is a set of services that bring together users and providers to form a multisided market. Is it possible then to take our “open platform” and start to think of a future in which we have products and services that actually do enable a re-imagining of healthcare provision to bring together patients, carers, health professionals, commissioners, analytics, researchers and all other stakeholders in a safe and secure manner?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;My blog post: &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/08/20/disruptive-influences-future.html&quot;&gt;Disruptive influences, the future. August 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it likely that the technology giants, such as Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft, already recognise the value in creating a new multi-sided marketplace for healthcare by the use of open standards and commodification of a platform. We already see how Apple has worked to permit patient access to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/03/doctors-put-patients-in-charge-with-apples-health-records-feature/&quot;&gt;medical records via the use of HL7 FHIR&lt;/a&gt;, Google has &lt;a href=&quot;https://healthitanalytics.com/news/google-using-fhir-deep-learning-for-healthcare-predictive-analytics&quot;&gt;embraced HL7 FHIR for predictive analytics and machine learning&lt;/a&gt; and launched a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalhealth.net/2018/03/google-launches-cloud-healthcare-api/&quot;&gt;cloud application programming interface to manage DICOM and HL7 FHIR data&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Google Cloud’s goal for healthcare is very much a reflection of Google’s overall mission: to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Applying this mission to healthcare means using open standards to help enable data sharing and interactive collaboration, while also providing a secure platform. Just imagine if all healthcare providers could easily, securely and instantaneously collaborate while caring for you. Ultimately, we hope that better flow of data will inspire new discoveries with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), leading to insights that improve patient outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Google Cloud blog, 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.google/topics/google-cloud/google-cloud-healthcare-new-apis-customers-partners-and-security-updates/&quot;&gt;https://blog.google/topics/google-cloud/google-cloud-healthcare-new-apis-customers-partners-and-security-updates/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must recognise that unlocking healthcare data opens up extraordinary potential advances and that, the use of open standards will enable a new generation of value-added data-driven services and applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personal goal is to create the next generation of electronic patient record systems with the aim to improve outcomes, but I recognise that to do that, we must strive for a open, dynamic data-driven healthcare environment onto which we can build innovation and build value. And that doesn’t yet exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With ubiquitous computing power available on demand, we should be planning now on how we will build and evaluate and then deploy automated tools to add value in healthcare. Such tools might triage, risk assess, interpret investigation results and support diagnosis and management, but we should aspire also to build tools, built on a foundation of meaningful data, to aid redesigning our healthcare systems around patients and not organisations and to, most importantly, improve outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I want to see a future in which the platform becomes an interchangeable commodity with innovation and differentiation occurring at a higher conceptual level of support for medical practice. Rather than simple data collection, our mission must be to imagine a future in which medical practice, which at its most fundamental is about clinical decision making, is supported by the most sophisticated tools possible to improve patient care.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This mission’s greatest risk is in the continued creation of data silos in which health information is locked away in proprietary systems. The answer is to create an open, extensible platform on which innovation can thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;My blog post: &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/06/15/embedding-data.html&quot;&gt;Embedding data in routine clinical practice, June 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is part three of a three-part series on why and how we should be building an open digital health platform in Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/digital-platform/2018/03/03/platform-wales-1.html&quot;&gt;Part one&lt;/a&gt; was a high-level overview of how standards and interoperability are critical in building a digital ecosystem. &lt;a href=&quot;/digital-platform/2018/03/03/platform-wales-1.html&quot;&gt;Part two&lt;/a&gt; assessed our current messaging-based architecture and highlighted the benefits of an API-first enterprise architecture together with the new technologies that have facilitated the move to cloud computing in other industries. This part ties together these strands into a manifesto for phase 1 of building our open platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to change what we are doing in Wales. We have two important reports that have criticised how healthcare information technology has been delivered - the Welsh Audit Office report and the Parliamentary Review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must ask hard questions about what we should do about the issues raised in the audit report including defects in governance and leadership, lack of delivery and concerns about the quality of information technology systems that are delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I believe that the only logical response to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wao.gov.uk/publication/informatics-systems-nhs-wales&quot;&gt;Welsh Audit Office report&lt;/a&gt; is to re-imagine the relationship between the NHS Wales Informatics Service (NWIS) and the health boards. Such a re-imagining requires us to stop ignoring the, in my view, currently incoherent set of responsibilities and divisions of labour that exist within Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;from my blog post, &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2018/01/19/focus-focus-focus.html&quot;&gt;“Focus focus focus”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my view, we need to focus our energy on creating an open platform onto which the next generation of applications, created internally and externally, can run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://gov.wales/docs/dhss/publications/180116reviewen.pdf&quot;&gt;Parliamentary Review of Health and Social Care report&lt;/a&gt;, published in January 2018 highlights the need for a seamless health and care system in Wales, centred around the citizen irrespective of where they live with the avoidance of creating artificial barriers between services and organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;from my blog post, &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2018/01/19/focus-challenges.html&quot;&gt;The challenges we face in delivering the vision&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, our services must re-focus on our citizens to transform healthcare with digital tools enabling that transformation. As I have written before, &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/12/05/enabling-innovation.html&quot;&gt;we need to enable innovation and invert the current paradox we have in command and control of our software systems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to recognise the obstacles in our way, some of them non-technical:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Strategies focus resources, energy, and attention on some objectives rather than others. Unless
collective ruin is imminent, a change in strategy will make some people worse off. Hence there will be powerful 
forces opposed to almost any change in strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When organisations are unable to make new strategies - when people evade the work of choosing among different paths into the future - then you get vague mom-and-apple-pie goals that everyone can agree on. Such goals are direct evidence of leadership’s insufficient will or political power to make or enforce hard choices. Put differently, universal buy-in usually signals the absence of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Good Strategy, Bad strategy” by Richard Rumelt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to make use of our existing good work and build on that. We cannot afford to rip-and-replace, but plan, pragmatically and carefully, taking advantage of the new digital technologies available to us, to transform our health system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;we-must-build-an-evolutionary-architecture&quot;&gt;We must build an evolutionary architecture&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An evolutionary architecture is one that supports change, recognising we need, both figuratively and literally, platform on which we can build solutions to meet our current &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; future needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principles to consider are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plan for change at the outset&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build a cohesive vision&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create modular services cared for by cross-functional teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-plan-for-change-at-the-outset&quot;&gt;1. Plan for change at the outset&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most appropriate way to build an evolutionary architecture is to ensure that support for evolutionary change is built-in to your designs at the outset. This means recognising the components that are likely to change and those that are not. On many occasions, I have stressed the need for clinical modelling in which we think carefully about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to create model data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A model is an abstraction of the real-world distilling knowledge into core concepts and processes. A model is a careful balance between complexity and over-simplification with models that are too complex model providing brittle abstractions which are poorly generalisable and models that are too simple model not supporting all of the demands placed upon it in real-life clinical scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;by me, &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/02/03/domain-driven-design.html&quot;&gt;Towards a domain-driven, model-based approach to developing clinical information systems: innovating for the future in NHS Wales&lt;/a&gt;, November 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, essentially, underpins a data-driven approach in we consider data and the computing services that operate on those data as our platform onto which ephemeral and lightweight applications can be built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also means that we leverage what we have already built in Wales and plan to build increasingly sophisticated functionality over time. As a result, we turn the existing ESB-based architecture into a more modern, API-based architecture in which data and services are made available to both internal and external users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-build-a-cohesive-vision&quot;&gt;2. Build a cohesive vision&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the components which underpin our platform must be &lt;em&gt;cohesive&lt;/em&gt;. Cohesion means that the plan and the components that make up delivery of that plan form a cohesive and integrated plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A coherent plan to deliver the [Informed Health and Care strategy] needs more than a list of disconnected and incompatible goals but instead a clear understanding of what needs to be done and what doesn’t need to be done; we must know when to say “no”. Instead, we focus our limited resources on specific tangible actions and make some difficult decisions to prune areas of work that do not support delivery of the wider vision.
[…]
As such, we need a coordinated all-Wales approach that permits all stakeholders to work cooperatively and collaboratively with clear lines of responsibility and governance. We need to re-organise our approach to healthcare information technology taking into account the steps needed to deliver the vision, the principles of enterprise architectural design, modern information standards and interoperability, modern quality improvement methodology and user-centred design.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;by me, &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2018/01/19/focus-focus-focus.html&quot;&gt;Focus focus focus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to build consensus around a cohesive plan to deliver the vision in the Informed Health and Care Strategy. This doesn’t mean getting everyone to agree, but requires political drive to make difficult decisions about what we can do with limited resources, taking into account our own strengths and weaknesses as public sector organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-create-modular-services-cared-for-by-cross-functional-teams&quot;&gt;3. Create modular services cared for by cross-functional teams&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest that you read the very helpful &lt;a href=&quot;https://apperta.org/_attachment/DefiningOpenPlatform/Apperta_Defining_an_Open_Platform_SP.pdf&quot;&gt;Apperta documents on “open platforms”&lt;/a&gt;. In it, they give a high-level overview of the typical ‘services’ which are required from an open platform. They suggest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identity assurance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data repositories&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Record location&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Resource discovery and scheduling&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Knowledge sources&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Legacy connectors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are a useful starting point, but the most helpful chapters are 3 and 4 on why an open platform is a good idea for healthcare and their proposed definition of an open platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Wales, I would argue that we need a phased approach to make the best use of the good work already done. This could include in phase 1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;User identity services
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Wrap existing “NADEX” Windows (Kerberos) domain controllers into an &lt;a href=&quot;https://oauth.net/2/&quot;&gt;OAUTH2&lt;/a&gt; service that be used to authenticate and authorise healthcare users. Later phases should include federation of other authentication providers in non-health domains such as social care.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Citizen identity and delegation. We need to evaluate different options including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/introducing-govuk-verify/introducing-govuk-verify&quot;&gt;GOV.UK VERIFY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Electronic staff record integration that, together with the user directory from NADEX, is exposed as a FHIR &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hl7.org/fhir/practitioner.html&quot;&gt;Practitioner resource&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patient identity services
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Wrap existing patient administration systems across Wales, the enterprise master patient index and the Welsh Demographic Service into a simple HL7 FHIR &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient.html&quot;&gt;Patient resource&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Results reporting and requesting services
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Wrap existing vendor neutral archive of results from the national laboratory information management system as a FHIR &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hl7.org/fhir/diagnosticreport.html&quot;&gt;Diagnostic report resource&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hl7.org/fhir/imagingstudy.html&quot;&gt;Imaging study resource&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Create new requesting service based on HL7 FHIR &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hl7.org/fhir/procedurerequest.html&quot;&gt;ProcedureRequest resource&lt;/a&gt; which acts as a concierge handling and delegating multiple different types of request to our existing underlying laboratory and radiology systems.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New e-Obs repository to include HL7 FHIR &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation.html&quot;&gt;Observation&lt;/a&gt; resource permitting storage and retrieval of observations such as pulse, blood pressure, temperature and weight and height.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Appointments and scheduling including providing federated read-only views initially across our multiple PAS and radiology services to provide &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hl7.org/fhir/episodeofcare.html&quot;&gt;Episode of care resources&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hl7.org/fhir/encounter.html&quot;&gt;Clinical encounters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hl7.org/fhir/appointment.html&quot;&gt;Appointments&lt;/a&gt;. Such a service could be used by professionals and citizens alike to see upcoming appointments for example.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A document repository, wrapping our existing national document repository (WCRS) but adding a more sophisticated metadata model to expose data as a HL7 FHIR &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hl7.org/fhir/documents.html&quot;&gt;Document resource&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reference data services including the UK-wide organisational data services (ODS) to create FHIR endpoints including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hl7.org/fhir/organization.html&quot;&gt;Organisation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hl7.org/fhir/healthcareservice.html&quot;&gt;Service&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hl7.org/fhir/location.html&quot;&gt;Location&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Centralised logging and audit services, exposing our existing national audit service as a FHIR &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hl7.org/fhir/auditevent.html&quot;&gt;Audit event resource&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These services are shown in schematic form here, from my &lt;a href=&quot;(/clinical-informatics/2017/10/19/data-driven.html)&quot;&gt;data-driven presentation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/digitalhealthconf/wardle-digital-health.018.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Wardle Digital Health.018&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These would form a bare-bones set of services that could be used by a new generation of applications providing the right information for users at the right time, whether professional, citizen or their delegate. In line with an evolutionary approach, we need to recognise the challenges ahead including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A robust approach to citizen consent in order to control how and why their health data is shared.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We need to start thinking about how &lt;a href=&quot;http://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html&quot;&gt;“API gateways”&lt;/a&gt; could be used across our health enterprise.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To work with industry on how we can enable an ecosystem of healthcare software and real-time analytics that permit the safe use of independent software modules within the wider ecosystem. We probably need something much like the Amazon AWS Serverless Application Model I have referenced previously when discussing &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/12/04/serverless.html&quot;&gt;“Serverless in healthcare”&lt;/a&gt;.  For example, how can we safely make use of a cloud-hosted service that is the result of machine learning that can tell us whether a chest x-ray is normal or abnormal? How can we make use of a new acute kidney injury algorithm? What are the technical and legal requirements we must solve to do that?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To work to change our governance and funding models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the latter point, we must recognise Conway’s Law:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“organizations which design systems … are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Conway, Melvin E. (April 1968), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.melconway.com/Home/Conways_Law.html&quot;&gt;“How do Committees Invent?”&lt;/a&gt;, Datamation, 14 (5): 28–31&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must, therefore, change our governance structures in tandem with changing our software architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is part two of a three-part series on why and how we should be building an open digital health platform in Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/digital-platform/2018/03/03/platform-wales-1.html&quot;&gt;Part one&lt;/a&gt; was a high-level overview of how standards and interoperability are critical in building a digital ecosystem. This part assesses our current messaging-based architecture and highlights the benefits of an API-first enterprise architecture together with the new technologies that have facilitated the move to cloud computing in other industries. &lt;a href=&quot;/digital-platform/2018/03/03/platform-wales-3.html&quot;&gt;Part three&lt;/a&gt; ties together these strands into a manifesto for phase 1 of building our open platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what is the most effective overall enterprise architecture that facilitates modern interoperability and an ecosystem, as described in &lt;a href=&quot;/digital-platform/2018/03/03/platform-wales-1.html&quot;&gt;part one&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any answer to that question must consider legacy systems already supporting clinical care within and between our organisations. There are many such services, such as patient administrative systems (eg HL7v2), laboratory information management systems, user identity and authentication and in Wales, we have an enterprise service bus (ESB)-based messaging architecture linking them together. In addition, there are sometimes explicit, often implicit reference data and rules and heuristics built into each application and service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first consideration is whether those services and applications currently deployed can support both robust interoperability and our ecosystem project. The second consideration is, if they cannot, how can we most effectively use what we have to do so?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;can-our-current-architecture-support-interoperability-and-an-ecosystem&quot;&gt;Can our current architecture support interoperability and an ecosystem?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ESB-architecture is one example of an event-driven architecture connecting disparate software without tight-coupling. An ESB is the typical technology used in Service Orientated Architectures (SOA) most popular several years ago. For example, there are a set of services and applications already in Wales supporting the care of patients on dialysis units across Wales. These take a live real-time feed of messages of laboratory results and persisting those data into a repository for the care of those patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ESB has supported integration, but it has required work &lt;em&gt;for all parties&lt;/em&gt;, internal and external, to perform that integration. Normally, an ESB will adopt a standards-based messaging protocol and so data are sent within a data “envelope”, usually SOAP, reflecting the technology of the time. This solves interoperability from a technical standpoint, but semantic and legal interoperability are out-of-scope. The ESB is therefore a component of an event-driven SOA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an event-driven architecture, it can be difficult to handle long-running business processes and orchestrate workflow across services. In addition, while applications and services are disconnected, separated by the ESB, the overall architecture is much like a monolith, but with the added complexity of a distributed system with every component part of a larger stream of messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes testing individual components difficult with changes in one system resulting in difficult to predict consequences on other systems. A test environment might need to replicate the entire ecosystem making it more difficult to automate and have confidence that any component or the whole ‘system’ is deterministic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, an ESB is an &lt;em&gt;internal&lt;/em&gt; solution to enterprise architecture integration. It is poorly suited to creating a truly open platform, although of course, can remain an important constituent part. We need to look elsewhere to see how technological trends could transform the way we build healthcare platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-can-we-learn-from-cloud-computing-and-modern-architectural-design&quot;&gt;What can we learn from cloud computing and modern architectural design?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have seen a revolution in both how data can be stored and how we can write software that operates on those data; we have &lt;em&gt;cloud computing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing brings together on-demand scalability and efficiency allowing organisations to consume storage and computing power to meet demand. Instead of running your own database in your own data centre, you can delegate its operation, backup and replication to a commercial supplier, normally on a pay-as-you-go basis. Example providers include Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move to a cloud-based architecture has been predicated upon technological advances and new approaches to the design, creation, testing and deployment of modern applications. However, these advances are not necessarily limited to deployment to the cloud. Technologies such as “containers” can be used in local data centres as well. As such, software code can be built as lightweight portable services deployed in-house or to an external hosting provider anywhere. Indeed, this vendor-neutrality means that in essence we are moving to a future in which hosting data and software services is a commodity. As a result of this flexibility, many enterprises adopt a hybrid approach in which their existing infrastructure continues to run on private networks hosted in private data centres but these are supplemented with new services provided using containers, deployed either in-house or by a cloud provider or in combination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern application development and operations (such as testing and deployment into live environments) are called “DevOps” and support greater degrees of agility in all steps of the software lifecycle so that development becomes more modular, modules become more isolated and independently test-able, and changes to those modules can be committed, tested and even deployed with little or no manual intervention. We know that modern technology companies like Google deploy billions of containers per week across their cloud infrastructure; to do so requires automation in deployment and scaling to meet their ever-increasing demands for computing power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new type of cloud-based architecture - Serverless - is increasingly popular, recognising that application developers wish to focus on their core business of creating value via writing software and not be concerned about the infrastructure that is needed to run that software. Serverless allows developers to write a function, which could perform any imagined well-defined computing task, and deploy it easily. Such a function can be used by other software components but the provider is responsible for automatically scaling the service to meet demand, expanding or contracting the resources required to computing power responsive to user need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are now seeing a new market for software code, in which re-usable independent modules of code, deployed as containers as “microservices” or as “serverless” functions, can be knitted together to create functionality for end-users.  These modules might look simple on the surface but hide (abstract) a great deal of complexity to deliver their results. Have a look at the speech recognition services now available from &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/?hp=tile&amp;amp;so-exp=below&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/speech/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;. Developers using those services simply send an audio file and receive back a text file containing the transcribed text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easy to see that such an architecture permits vendor-neutrality, in which we could substitute one service for another based on quality and price, with our changes limited to changing how we locate the resources used to knit together an end-to-end solution for our users. Substitutability is an important architectural principle for future-proofing and requires us to adopt standardised and open application programming interfaces (APIs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am convinced that we will see an increasingly sophisticated marketplace providing on-demand computing services in the next five years; for example, see the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/&quot;&gt;Amazon Serverless Application Repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, we should recognise that cloud computing should inform our architectural designs for healthcare:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Virtually unlimited computing power on an as-required, scalable basis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Openness, modularisation and abstraction of software to appropriately ‘decouple’ software and thus facilitating evolutionary change.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sophisticated support for “DevOps” in the develop-test-deploy software lifecycle with a focus on automation and rapid ‘agile’ development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;an-api-first-approach-for-an-open-architecture&quot;&gt;An API-first approach for an open architecture&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not difficult to see how healthcare has lagged behind other industries in adopting a more “open” approach to information technology. Most healthcare software has traditionally been dominated by vendors who supply whole-organisation scale software products that are usually ‘closed’ systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open systems provide interoperability so that different components from different vendors can communicate and exchange meaningful information. In addition, open systems support &lt;em&gt;portability&lt;/em&gt; of applications and services. Portability means that software can be written once and deployed without change irrespective of the environment in which it is deployed. Portability requires standardisation and usually some form of runtime configuration and resource location. For example, to use a health example, if an application expects to use HL7 FHIR to fetch blood results and perform analytics, it should be possible to deploy that application within any ecosystem that provides those HL7 FHIR endpoints. These endpoints are what we mean by an standard “API”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is an “API”? An API is an &lt;em&gt;application programming interface&lt;/em&gt;. Crudely, it is a set of usually related software functions that, for our purposes, can be called by one system to execute software functionality in another. Essentially, an API is an abstraction, a way of decoupling how a software service is used from its implementation. In the example above, you do not need to know how Amazon or Google have implemented their speech transcription service, you send the text file and get back text. For all you know, they have thousands of transcriptionists sitting at computers listening with headphones and typing! In addition, you do not really care whether they change how they implement the transcription service, so long as you get back the results you expect. They could switch over to a new implementation and you wouldn’t know. The use of APIs has meant you have isolated different modules of software from each other and permitted work to continue independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, we might expect to be able to make use of a module to identify acute kidney injury (AKI). Currently, this could simply implement the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.england.nhs.uk/akiprogramme/aki-algorithm/&quot;&gt;national AKI algorithm&lt;/a&gt; but, could &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; be used to inform and develop the next-generation of algorithm that could perhaps identify patients &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; there is kidney injury and be &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; replaced with more sophisticated algorithms with different and hopefully improved receiver-operator curves for the patient group at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all APIs are “standard”. Proprietary APIs might allow interoperability but at the expense of new work, perhaps on both sides, to perform integration. Similarly, proprietary interfaces usually expose implementation details so that rather than being appropriately decoupled, the two separate software systems become entwined and dependent -  much like a limpet clinging to a rock than flexible and interchangeable plugs and sockets we all use for our electrical devices in the home!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A focus on open and standard APIs is key to creating a powerful ecosystem so that both internal and external developers can contribute and work independently. Our ecosystem project in Wales must not simply cater to external users but &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; the platform on which new innovation can occur both internally and in partnership with others. This is a paradigm shift from the closed approach we have seen in healthcare in the past and treats external developers as first-class citizens in our digital health ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our efforts in Wales on standards, interoperability and the digital ecosystem must therefore build a ‘connected business platform’ usable by developers, internal and external, on behalf of users, across health and care and most importantly the patient and their delegates, to support a transformation in how we deliver healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;privacy-and-trust&quot;&gt;Privacy and trust&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important not to confuse “openness” with a lack of data security. Openness, at a principle in software architecture, relates to interoperability.  For example, TCP/IP, the technical underpinnings of the Internet, is an open protocol but that does not stop it being used by your bank to offer online banking to authorise and execute financial transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An open architecture does not mean that confidential patient information is made accessible to all. Any design for a target architecture for Wales must take into account the need for authentication (‘you are you say are’), authorisation (‘you are allowed to do what you are asking to do’) and verifiable logging (‘we are watching what you do’) as well as need to handle different levels of sensitive information. For example, it would be expected that sexual health, genomic, mental health and social care data might be treated differently to general health data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, not only might accessibility depend on the type of data, but the intended use of those data. For example, so that data made available for direct patient care might depend on the direct care relationship between citizen and professional while aggregated data for a clinical service or organisation used for planning and performance management and data made available to researchers would be handled quite differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to ensure privacy and trust when one uses as ‘push’ based messaging fabric like an ESB because data are sent to services who consume or decide to discard those messages. An API-based approach is usually a ‘pull’ service, in which a client requests something from a service and so a service can decide whether to satisfy that request by virtue of authentication and authorisation and can log such access via a logging service. Of course, an API-based approach can adapt to a ‘push’ model usually via ‘publish-and-subscribe’ in which interested clients subscribe to notifications from a service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;so-what-next&quot;&gt;So what next?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next question to ask is, what are the next steps that we need to take to build an open platform in Wales using these architectural design principles? I have tried to answer this in my &lt;a href=&quot;/digital-platform/2018/03/03/platform-wales-3.html&quot;&gt;next post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is part one of a three-part series on why and how we should be building an open digital health platform in Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This part is a high-level overview of how standards and interoperability are critical in building a digital ecosystem. &lt;a href=&quot;/digital-platform/2018/03/03/platform-wales-2.html&quot;&gt;Part two&lt;/a&gt; assesses our current messaging-based architecture and highlights the benefits of an API-first enterprise architecture together with the new technologies that have facilitated the move to cloud computing in other industries. &lt;a href=&quot;/digital-platform/2018/03/03/platform-wales-3.html&quot;&gt;Part three&lt;/a&gt; ties together these strands into a manifesto for phase 1 of building our open platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I firmly believe that Wales has potential to be the best place in the World for digitally-enabled healthcare and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we need to change what we have been doing. We need to move away from the single portal approach advocated by some and move to building an open platform, as I have &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/10/19/data-driven.html&quot;&gt;previously discussed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;standards-and-interoperability&quot;&gt;Standards and interoperability&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our “Once-for-Wales” task and finish group has finished its work and we have recommended a new Welsh Technical Standards Board (WTSB) be set up to define and mandate the technical and semantic standards for interoperability across our principality. We have recognised that there are many services and system functions, such as patient demographics and identity, that should be provided nationally for every citizen in Wales across all of our health and social care organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, we recognise that we must be able to exchange information with others, within Wales and without; including organisations outside of Wales. The latter is vital for patients who live on the border between Wales and England, and for those specialist service providers who care for patients from a different region. For instance, many specialist services in North Wales are provided from Liverpool, and we send patients from South Wales to either Bristol, Birmingham or London for highly specialist support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But information exchange is not simply limited to health. We need to communicate with and build workflows across multiple disciplinary ‘borders’ including social care, the third-sector, academic researchers and service planners. Such communications must be acceptable to citizens, requiring implicit or explicit consent depending on purpose and level of aggregation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people think we should write national one-size-fits-all applications and think about the interoperability aspects later. I would argue that interoperability is not something that can be “added later on” but must be designed at the outset, understanding that we must not only support technical interoperability but exchange semantically-meaningful information within a broader legal data sharing environment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Legal interoperability covers the broader environment of laws, policies, procedures and
cooperation agreements needed to allow the seamless exchange of information
between different organisations, regions and countries.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Semantic interoperability refers to the ability to ensure that the precise meaning of
exchanged information is unambiguously interpretable by any other system, service or
user.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Technical interoperability means the ability of two or more information and
communication technology applications, to accept data from each other and perform a
given task in an appropriate and satisfactory manner without the need for extra
operator intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;from &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/health//sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/ev_20121107_wd02_en.pdf&quot;&gt;eHealth Governance Initiative - Discussion paper on semantic and technical interoperability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important standards that should underpin our new open platform are SNOMED CT and HL7-FHIR. I have covered both of these technologies at length previously including a &lt;a href=&quot;/cis-design/2017/05/02/data-standards.html&quot;&gt;simple overview in this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;digital-ecosystems&quot;&gt;Digital ecosystems&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, many of us in Wales recognise the need to prioritise our limited resources and form partnerships with others. We cannot do everything ourselves and we should bring in partners who have strengths to complement our own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In keeping with this view, Welsh Government have funded a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lifescienceshubwales.com/dhew/&quot;&gt;Digital Health Ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; bringing together the Life Sciences Hub in Cardiff with the NHS Wales Informatics Service to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;accelerate the delivery and adoption of the latest digital solutions to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;create a pathway for access to health and care data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;foster innovation from all stakeholders, encouraging cross sector cooperation and implementation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;support the development of new products and services to drive business growth, job security and creation, ensuring prosperity for all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, we are starting the journey towards opening up our architecture in order to make it easier to work in partnership with others. We need to identify the strengths and weaknesses across both the public and private sectors and create an ecosystem that permits us to leverage the strengths of both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is, how can we build healthcare information technology architectures that can connect with external systems and data sources outside of our traditional walls?  It should not be surprising that robust interoperability is essential to delivering a working digital ecosystem in Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, interoperability isn’t something to think about later, it should be &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; we build our systems today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next question to ask is, do we currently have an architecture that can enable robust interoperability and satisfy our ambitions for our digital health ecosystem, and if we don’t, then we must also ask what we need to do in order to do so? Some of the answers are in the &lt;a href=&quot;/digital-platform/2018/03/03/platform-wales-2.html&quot;&gt;next post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1zZtnV44vgU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My electronic patient record system uses SNOMED-CT as its lingua-franca. Notice in the video how it maps free text into the UK dm+d (dictionary of medicines and devices), parsing dose route and directions and handling units and equivalence. It suggests a correction when I mistype salbutamol. There is a lot going on under the surface!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the entered term acetaminophen is switched to the preferred term, paracetamol. Doctors of a certain age will recognise that bendrofluazide was the term for the drug now known as bendroflumethiazide. Likewise, the doses, frequencies and routes are parsed from free-text into structured, coded, SNOMED-CT data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/so-i-wrote/medication-mapped.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Medication Mapped&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using that information, the software generates a permanent artefact of the consultation, combining human-viewable PDF with structured semantically-useful information for machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It calculates in real-time what medications have started, have stopped, are unchanged or have had a change made. If you start doing that, you can track medication changes over a long period of time and show them graphically. The software can calculate the total daily dose, understanding the dose, units and frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/so-i-wrote/medication-graphed.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Medication Graphed&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice how we can see how the doses have changed or started or stopped over time. For our patients with long-term health conditions, this is very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;structured-documents&quot;&gt;Structured documents&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t understand how some folk think about structured documents as simply documents with the same types of headings. To me, clinical documents should be structured so that they are useful to humans but also useful to machines. The headings and the information models needed are related but different. We have to make medical data understandable by both humans and machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For too long we have created documents from which we hope to derive data. Why not create documents from our data, instead?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here we record what botulinum toxin injections we have used and generate a letter that goes into the organisation’s document repository…. but we keep the data in a useful and structured format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ekeblq9YEg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, if I record a patient’s specialist walking assessment then we can use SNOMED-CT as a useful, intermediary structure to allow semantic interoperability. Semantic interoperability means that software written by other people can derive meaning from the data that I exchange with it. Users don’t need to see this, but computers do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This form, viewable by the professional in the EPR, was populated by the patient entering their information into their iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/so-i-wrote/edss.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Edss&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for interoperability, behind-the-scenes, other software can understand what we’ve done, without necessarily having to understand the Kurtzke EDSS scale. They can, in essence, answer the question “Can this patient walk?” without difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a simple flat representation of the information from this encounter, recording diagnoses, treatments and outcomes. Even a flat representation allows us to later perform sophisticated searches such as, which patients are currently taking methotrexate. Similarly, I have exposed internal data as HL7 FHIR endpoints using the HAPI libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/so-i-wrote/snomed-intermediary.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Snomed Intermediary&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My document therefore consists of a PDF for human consumption and large amounts of structured and semantically useful data that can be processed for that individual or for a whole cohort of patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;cohorts&quot;&gt;Cohorts&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defining cohorts is important to me, based on service, diagnosis, problem, treatment, intervention or any arbitrary combination thereof. Understanding cohorts is a pre-requisite for understanding outcomes and value. See my previous blog post on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/8MCOn73pCZ&quot;&gt;importance of cohorts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most users have no idea that they are using SNOMED, if you do this right. Here we are entering country of birth, ethnicity and occupation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/so-i-wrote/background.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Background&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice how the countries are grouped as American, Asian and European. This isn’t hard-coded but instead I have set a single property to categorise each country-of-birth term by region in the SNOMED-CT hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internally, I have built a range of different UI components that are configured declaratively to allow choice of SNOMED concept from different subsets or parts of the hierarchy. Here are the rules defining the country of birth pop-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/so-i-wrote/rule-engine.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Rule Engine&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Declarative architectures are extremely powerful and support building systems responsive to need. I can change most of the application’s behaviour at runtime by using an administrative portal and the rule engine. Most data collection forms are automatically generated from the underlying data model without any additional work for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entering terms should be quicker than using free text. Try entering “MI” into my basic demonstration application - &lt;a href=&quot;https://msdata.org.uk/apps/WebObjects/SnomedBrowser.woa/&quot;&gt;https://msdata.org.uk/apps/WebObjects/SnomedBrowser.woa/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/so-i-wrote/snomed-search.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Snomed Search&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you give tools to professionals that make it easier to enter coded structured information than free-text, they will do so. Coding diagnoses, procedures and background information is critical in understanding outcome data; they are a foundation on which more complex and sophisticated analytics can be built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;patients&quot;&gt;Patients&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2015, I have been trialling the use of iPads to allow patients to directly contribute to their records. The obvious next step is to roll this out more fully and permit patients to use their own devices, rather than devices we lend them in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, a member of the clinic staff logs in and chooses a patient from the clinic list for the day. This is fetched by the iPad via the EPR to one of two PAS in Wales to which I have interfaced, depending on clinic context. For demonstration purposes, I have built a fake PAS so I don’t inadvertently share patient-identifiable information for these videos:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/NGbQIT5uFQ4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iPad is handed to the patient for them to complete. As the experience is locked to that patient, they cannot “go back” and look at the list of patients or see any information that they shouldn’t be able to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can configure what to show dynamically based on diagnosis, context and previous responses. I want to start showing the complete patient record at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here is it running in “Parkinson’s clinic” mode, showing different questionnaires adaptively. The important feature is that patient data is available immediately for the consultation for clinical care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/pAmaUXMu_bk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, most of the useful data goes into the automatically generated letter and is obviously available to be charted over time for that single patient, or aggregated later on for audit and research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/so-i-wrote/m4-epr-results.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;M4 Epr Results&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patient is asked whether they wish to take part in research and then shown research projects and consent forms suitable to them, by virtue of applied inclusion and exclusion criteria, mainly using SNOMED-CT subsumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/so-i-wrote/m2-research-registration.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;M2 Research Registration&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all configured at runtime obviously using my administrative portal. Here I edit the consent form interactively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/so-i-wrote/m5-epr-consent.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;M5 Epr Consent&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/so-i-wrote/m5-epr-edit-consent.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;M5 Epr Edit Consent&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And once I sign off that consent form, it is used immediately by all iPads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/KBLDA42TwzU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;technical-architecture&quot;&gt;Technical architecture&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have built it slowly and incrementally using PostgreSQL and java for the web-based application. This exposes an interface for humans via a web front-end and a range of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer&quot;&gt;RESTful services&lt;/a&gt; for use by machines. I built the iOS applications in objective-C originally and then migrated to Swift for the current versions. These talk to the main EPR via HTTPS. The iOS applications use &lt;a href=&quot;http://researchkit.org/&quot;&gt;Apple’s ResearchKit framework&lt;/a&gt; to implement dynamic questionnaires and active tasks such as a finger tapping test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important facets is the abstraction of multiple other external services, such as services provided by a hospital PAS (patient administrative system) and document repositories. While my software could be used standalone, it isn’t really designed to work like that and instead wants to interoperate with a broad set of external services. It wants to talk and exchange structured codified clinically-driven data with other systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much software is focused on a single organisation, but our multidisciplinary teams cross both disciplinary and organisation divides! Therefore, my application can be configured to interact with multiple external software systems to make the user experience more seamless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-has-this-taught-me&quot;&gt;What has this taught me?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Technical and semantic interoperability with the use of standards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encapsulation and substitutability&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Decoupling&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coherent architectural design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the hard work has been in getting permission and then implementing technical interfaces to other systems. It would have been much easier for me to create valuable software if I had a set of tools and frameworks on which to build. This is reason why I am a advocate for an open platform approach in healthcare information technology so that we can build a stable infrastructure and yet still enable transformative innovation and embrace new digital technologies such as machine learning. I shouldn’t be wasting my time building the foundations of applications, but instead I should be able to leverage a suite of frameworks and tools on which hitherto unconsidered new and exciting functionality can be built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When any of us build an application for iOS or Android, we don’t start with nothing but have a suite of frameworks and tools to enable drag-and-drop user interface design, data persistence and cloud synchronisation. Why don’t we have the same for healthcare yet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My future plans are to break-up the application into a suite of interoperating microservices. I have already done that for my SNOMED-CT terminology engine, first of all as a java-based microservice and now one built using golang. As I do this, I rewrite my original application to make use of the standalone service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have written about the potential benefits of &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/12/04/serverless.html&quot;&gt;microservices and serverless architectures in healthcare previously&lt;/a&gt;), including the declarative nature of combining those services together by carefully considering how data flows between them in order to deliver value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need open architectures that interoperate, are standards-compliant and multi-layered. Foundational services, such as data persistence and core services like terminology should be used by more specialist and increasingly high-value functionality such as read-time analytics and aggregators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see a future in which those foundational services are provided via open-source tools and new commercial models evolve selling advanced services on a pay-as-you-go model. For example, would any of you want to take advantage of a disease-modifying treatment service that monitors your patients on drugs like methotrexate and orders blood tests when needed and lets you know when their blood counts drop?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to define a standards-based framework which means that we can not only deploy such innovative technology, but enable their assessment and evaluation in a safe way. One of the ways of enabling that are the principles of decoupling, encapsulation and substitutability, in which we can safely replace a modular component without other modules being aware. Only then can we enable safe technological-focused quality improvement and research, by running A-B testing in which different algorithms can be tested in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such aspirations require a renewed focus on consent and in particular, making it possible to seek explicit opt-in consent in an easy way from citizens. Why not use technology to show informative video, interactive consent tools and start to recruit the majority of our patients into many different types of research project, obtaining robust and useful data on the effects of interventions, including the applied use of machine learning and algorithms, across our health systems?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can no longer think in terms of monolithic applications and think of interoperability as something to tack on after those applications are finished. Instead, we should focus on how we build an open platform to enable distributed applications and services and permit innovators to stitch together that functionality in novel ways to support and improve and re-imagine our healthcare services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2018/01/19/focus-challenges.html&quot;&gt;part two of this series&lt;/a&gt;, I attempted to articulate the challenges we face; concluding that essentially, we need to balance centralised planning and control with support for innovation and change, particularly given the new technologies on the horizon which offer the potential to transform how we configure and deliver care to our citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this part, I discuss some possible solutions to the obstacles we face including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;adopting good information system design principles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;focusing on process and workflow and user-centred design&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;delivering an open enterprise health and care informatics platform&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;re-imagining the organisational structures and their responsibilities and governance in Wales&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;prioritisation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-do-we-meet-those-challenges&quot;&gt;How do we meet those challenges?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WAO rightly recommends deep clinical and managerial engagement and so suggests that NWIS and NHS bodies should work together to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“strengthen the relationship between developers and clinicians, particularly in designing and testing new systems and functions, so that there is a better collective understanding of what is wanted and what is possible; and [..] engage with managers to identify their information needs as well as the needs of clinicians.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I do not believe that this recommendation, or any of their other recommendations, to be sufficiently far-reaching to effect substantial change for NHS Wales IT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is helpful to review the UK &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles&quot;&gt;“Government Digital Service” design principles&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start with user needs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do less&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Design with data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do the hard work to make it simple&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iterate, then iterate again&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is for everyone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understand context&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build digital services, not websites&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be consistent, not uniform&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make things open: it makes things better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital transformation is complex and needs deep involvement of the whole service and not simply an “information technology project”. Indeed, to make the most effective use of information technology, that technology must be used hand-in-hand to enable service transformation. Few would argue that organisational change is rather more difficult to execute that deploying software and yet why is it that we expect a third-party organisation to parachute into another organisation and deliver change? It is therefore evident that successful healthcare information technology requires partnerships and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, at a clinical design meeting on Friday, the implementation of an “outpatient administrative outcome form” was discussed. For background, we were shown the advanced end-to-end service transformation work at Abertawe Bro Morgannwg involving linking up multiple disparate systems to digitise the outpatient department. This work combined a commercial patient-call system with access to clinical documents, investigation results and tracking the workflow from patient arrival to their attendance for investigations or procedures. The striking conclusion must be that service transformation must be driven by local NHS organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would not matter if there were three or three-hundred clinicians in the room to design an “outpatient administrative outcome form”, if the scope of the challenge is limited to the design of a form and not the end-to-end service change for which it is but one component; clinical engagement does not fix the inherent design flaw or failure of limited project scope that does not factor into the end-to-end process re-design required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another major obstacle within NHS Wales is the existing current and legacy information technology solutions in place across different organisations and as a result, their varying priorities in relation to digital transformation. There is significant variation in digital maturity across different Welsh Health Boards. Such differences risk placing any national strategy, or indeed any organisation tasked with delivering that strategy such as NWIS, into an impossible situation trying to meet disparate or even opposing priorities or accommodating compromise in design or functionality. Such conflicting priorities result only in user dissatisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge then is to ensure that innovation of design, of process and of information technology in one part of Wales can be rapidly spread to other areas. Rapidly scaling out good practice requires information technology that can work in different environments with minimal change. If software is developed interfacing to bespoke or proprietary local systems, then it is necessarily much more difficult to deploy it in other environments. We cannot, for example, take the clinician portal (CWS) used in Aneurin Bevan Health Board and deploy it into Cardiff and Vale, despite the fact that it offers valuable clinical functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;delivering-an-open-standards-based-digital-health-platform-for-wales&quot;&gt;Delivering an open, standards-based digital health platform for Wales&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need a technical architecture that can support all of this complexity, allow innovation and parallel working at pace and yet provide assurance and governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of you heard my talk on Data-driven Healthcare at the inaugural Digital Health and Care Conference in August 2017.  In it, I advocate for a standards-based, open computing platform built on data and services. From McKinsey:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Consider an open innovation platform that holds healthcare data, and provides data access that is enabled for application programming interfaces as well as common technical IT services such as identity, access, or consent management.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;McKinsey, January 2016&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, Gartner, 2016, developed the theme of a computing platform onto which digital businesses can be built, exposing services to customers (patients), employees (professionals), things (devices such as home monitors, wearables, mobile device applications etc) and partners (a digital ecosystem).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/digitalhealthconf/wardle-digital-health.016.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Wardle Digital Health.016&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my view, “Once for Wales” should mean we focus on delivering a suite of data and software services that support a suite of lightweight user-facing applications. The whole system must be designed to be interconnected and consists of lots of small pieces each one “channel agnostic” and each re-usable, perhaps in ways hitherto not considered in order to innovate in the future. Data flows between these components via application programming interfaces (APIs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my illustrative schematic in which we open up our core services, create a platform leveraging new technologies (such as HL7 FHIR) to expose application programming interfaces that can be used by multiple applications providing different views and different perspectives on a single patient record or collections of those records.  We must focus on data standards and interoperability, creating lightweight applications at pace and design useful real-time analytics services for clinicians and managers. Critically, we build a platform that can provide the building blocks for future innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/digitalhealthconf/wardle-digital-health.018.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Wardle Digital Health.018&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, another definition of a “platform” is a set of services that bring together users and providers to form a multisided market. Is it possible then to take our “open platform” and start to think of a future in which we have products and services that actually do enable a re-imagining of healthcare provision to bring together patients, carers, health professionals, commissioners, analytics, researchers and all other stakeholders in a safe and secure manner?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/08/20/disruptive-influences-future.html&quot;&gt;disruptive influences in healthcare blog post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, our health platforms, if they exist at all, are lopsided asymmetric systems in which patients play little or no role. We must start thinking about creating a data-driven architecture that corrects this asymmetry in power and control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gov.wales/docs/dhss/publications/180116reviewen.pdf&quot;&gt;Parliamentary Review of Health and Social Care report&lt;/a&gt;, there is explicit recognition of needing to balance enabling nuanced local response and specialisation with a centrally dictated state unable to adequately adapt to need at pace. It suggests a need for a set of agreed national broad principles with appropriate central governance and local involvement. Those broad principles should be focused on data standards and software services with a clear set of application programming interfaces using which, we can build the next generation of innovative user-facing applications, whether for professionals or patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must recognise that cooperation and standardisation must be mandated for our core platform of national services, with data structures and application programming interfaces defined clearly to the benefit of all. Likewise, creating a layered architecture in which data persistence, business rules and logic and presentation layers are separate and linked by well-defined human and technological contracts, defining the interactions and the results that are to be expected, permits us to have different governance structures. As I wrote in the &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/12/06/5os-health.html&quot;&gt;5 O’s of healthcare IT&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Recognise the relative unchanging components and iterate and prototype the components that change more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;How can we develop a “can-do” digital culture in healthcare? Should we clone the “Move fast and break things” culture reported in technological startups? Not really! We need to approach information technology in a different way but we can’t “break things”! We work in a safety-critical environment, but we must recognise that the pace of change and the level of risk can be different at different levels of our enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/12/06/5os-health.html&quot;&gt;The 5 O’s of healthcare IT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;re-organising-healthcare-it-in-wales&quot;&gt;Re-organising healthcare IT in Wales&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A basic challenge we face is to match our clinical and administrative problems with technological opportunities including new ways of working that new technologies make possible. This challenge is particularly difficult because some of our day-to-day problems still have no straightforward technical solutions and many new technologies may impact on our provision of healthcare in ways that we cannot yet clearly articulate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counter this challenge, we must accept that we do not have all of the answers and must build systems and software that can meet both current and future demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my view, NWIS should be broken-up into functional units with clear lines of governance and focused responsibilities, with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A platform group, responsible for core components of the “Once for Wales” health platform, providing data and services to professionals, the patient and third-parties with strong analytics support.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An applications group, providing lightweight building blocks of user-interface components which can be used by health organisations in conjunction with their existing resources.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A data standards and governance group, to oversee the platform and its design as well as provide governance and sign-off of permission to connect by both internal and external systems.   This group would contain WISB and WTSB and govern the performance of both the platform and applications group.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An infrastructure group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current plan to deliver the strategy, created by NWIS, is focused on delivering a portal. This plan, in my opinion, is not fit-for-purpose and must be vigorously challenged. A portal approach, in which one plans a national portal through which all functionality is provided, risks creating a brittle top-down centralised design, needlessly limits innovation and does not take full advantage of the use of information technology to re-imagine and transform our clinical services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, NWIS should become a provider of a platform and a toolbox of components useful for building clinical applications that use open industry-standards such as HL7 FHIR and SNOMED-CT. The services and modules provided by the groups would be mandated by an all-Wales governance group on behalf of NHS Wales representing all stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we need to carefully balance decentralisation and ensure that no organisation is left behind. As such, centralised teams containing expertise in technology, user-experience and design should be made available to organisations to support their transformation programmes, leveraging our open platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;priorities---what-is-our-focus&quot;&gt;Priorities - what is our focus?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be surprised to hear that we still do not have access to clinical documents and investigation results across Wales. These two priorities must be delivered before any new projects are started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The platform team should focus, in the first year, on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Exposing the Welsh Results Reporting Service (WRRS) as a national open service, ensuring all results are available across Wales irrespective of organisation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Exposing the document service as a national open service.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Building a national demographic service wrapping the existing eMPI and WDS/NSTS.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creating a national pathway service, providing administrative support for tracking pathways across organisations and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Making the National Intelligent Integrated Audit Service (NIIAS) available as a service and at the service layer rather than only via specific applications.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Building a national test requesting concierge service handling investigation requests, whether laboratory or radiology, seamlessly by encapsulated lower-level systems such as RADIS and LIMS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should develop a range of key performance indicators for each core national service to include functionality and performance. For example, demographic services providing a unified wrap of the enterprise master patient index using a modern FHIR-based API might be expected to return results matching on &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; demographic identifiers within &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; microseconds. Breaking up an architecture into modular independent microservices permits automatic scaling and monitoring and simplifies testing which can be performed in isolation and automatically when software code is changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new website should be created, &lt;strong&gt;https://api.wales.nhs.uk&lt;/strong&gt; providing service documentation, code examples and governance procedures for each service as well as way for internal and external organisations to register user-facing applications and submit requests for connection to the wider platform. Our design and service work should be public, open and transparent. National services and the organisation running them should be the servant of users, including health and care organisations in Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The applications group should focus on breaking-up WCP into modular re-usable components, identifying and removing important business logic which should be implemented at the service-layer. The results viewing component should simply leverage the underlying services and be a lightweight wrapper that can be used to support multiple workflows dependent on the clinical context. Applications should be ephemeral and lightweight; designed for customisation and integration into the myriad of complex healthcare workflows that exist across our country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure group must begin an options analysis of the costs and security implications of running server infrastructure on existing hardware or commodity UK-based cloud providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must be honest about what we can and cannot do in Wales. There are existing commercial solutions for a range of user-facing applications and it makes little sense to duplicate that functionality. Similarly, why should NWIS develop software for outpatient outcome recording to fix a problem that ABM, ABHB and CAV have already solved? Instead, NWIS should be focused on delivering what no-one else can, an open, standards-based, consent-driven digital health platform. No health board or commercial entity can build that; let’s focus on creating an enabling technology platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such an approach will allow health boards to adopt new functionality at their own pace and develop solutions themselves leveraging the same shared platform. One current failing across Wales is that local developments are orthogonal to the national shared interest because, in the absence of a truly open standards-based platform, software is developed tightly bound to local systems. As such, those new developments are not easily scaled across the wider economy. As such, we should mandate that local developments leverage the national platform and that those developments are made available to other NHS organisations when complete via a shared open-source code repository. It would then be possible for new developments developed elsewhere to be scaled rapidly across all of our services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separately, the standards and governance team should provide an interoperability toolkit to be used for scoring both internal and external applications on a range of interoperability factors including the use of existing national services, adoption of approved data standards and plans for the future. Such a toolkit would be used to drive the adoption of standards over time and improve compatibility with the national platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we should be working in the open. My blog is one example of this; we should foster debate of the difficult issues, acknowledging that there is no easy or straightforward solution, but only compromise, collaboration and cooperation to do the right thing for patients in Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this part, I try to articulate the importance challenges we face in delivering the vision, concluding that essentially, we need to balance centralised planning and control with support for innovation and change, particularly given the new technologies on the horizon which offer the potential to transform how we configure and deliver care to our citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need a coherent plan to deliver our vision. In &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2018/01/19/focus-solutions.html&quot;&gt;part 3, I discuss the best way to meet those challenges.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-are-the-challenges-we-face&quot;&gt;What are the challenges we face?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what are our challenges in delivering the vision today?  We can look to the recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wao.gov.uk/publication/informatics-systems-nhs-wales&quot;&gt;Welsh Audit Office report&lt;/a&gt;; this has raised important concerns about healthcare information technology in Wales including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Highlighting the inherent complexity of deploying information technology across a large complex system, spread across multiple organisations, with staff operating out of hospitals, GP practices and in the community.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Significant delays in delivery of projects&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lack of strategic prioritisation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Disagreements between some NHS bodies and NWIS in relation to delivery and the meaning of “Once for Wales”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A need to strengthen leadership&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Weakness in governance arrangements, lack of independent scrutiny and unbalanced reporting of progress&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inadequate funding&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inconsistent planning with a need to aligning plans across organisations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Issues of information technology staff capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Issues of clinical engagement and dissatisfaction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Concerns about the quality and functionality of many national systems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unclear lines of responsibility in relation to delivering and monitoring the benefits of projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we must also consider what challenges our services will face in the future. Healthcare is ever-changing and there are a number of transformative and disruptive influences in health that, together with new technology, are driving and will continue to drive new ways of working. I wrote about these in my &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2017/07/07/disruptive-influences-health.html&quot;&gt;disruptive challenges series of blog posts&lt;/a&gt;. Are we confident that we have an environment in Wales that is primed to take advantage of current and future technologies?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Changes in model of care:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Management of multiple long-term health conditions, cross-disciplinary teamwork, non-health partnerships including social care and third-sector&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Shared care and shared records&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Remote monitoring using modern technology including wearables and the “Internet of things”.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Focus on health outcomes and prudent healthcare, a need to support big data and real-time analytics and embed artificial intelligence into management and clinical practice.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patients as active participants:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;View and contribute to their own records, recording their own aims and objectives and target outcomes&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Communication with the healthcare team&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Control the sharing of their information for direct care, for service evaluation and for research via consent and robust citizen identity services&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hospitals without walls:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Increasing availability of personal mobile devices, wearables and smart home monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;New commercial models of care and software provision&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://gov.wales/docs/dhss/publications/180116reviewen.pdf&quot;&gt;Parliamentary Review of Health and Social Care report&lt;/a&gt;, published in January 2018 highlights the need for a seamless health and care system in Wales, centred around the citizen irrespective of where they live with the avoidance of creating artificial barriers between services and organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It highlights that service redesign can be enabled by the appropriate use of digital technology. In addition, it explains how frontline innovation across different parts of Wales has already emerged and the importance of being able to disseminate good practice once proven stressing the importance of adopting continuous quality improvement methodologies to create a learning health and care system. Similarly, it recognises that different localities across Wales do not need to operate in the same way or that services must be identical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that report, similar concerns to that from the WAO were raised :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Simply put, activity is just too dispersed and stretched, and lacks overall commitment around a unified vision and set of priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the report draws out the seemingly conflicting goals between local variation and harmonisation and standardisation. We want to support innovation, appropriate variation in services and the delivery of a thriving digital ecosystem supporting local industry and at the same time reduce needless variation, share good practice and harmonise across systems?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I do not, for example, want patients to be disadvantaged because the technology used in one health board is different to another and the information available is incomplete and the pathway of care disrupted. This is why Wales has committed to working together to adopt common information services and I expect all parts of the NHS in Wales, supported by the Informatics Service, to adopt them&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Dr Andrew Goodall,  Chief Executive, NHS Wales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we deliver these two seemingly mutually exclusive goals?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer, of course, is to understand that coordination and central control can be applied differently depending on what is being discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Thus we should seek coordinated policies only when the gains are very large. There will be costs to demanding coordination, because it will ride roughshod over economies of specialization and more nuanced local responses. The brilliance of good organization is not in making sure that everything is connected to everything else. How that road lies a frozen maladaptive stasis. Good strategy and good organization lie in specializing on the right activities and imposing only the essential amount of coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our strategy must therefore take into account a need for national coordination for some areas of our work and yet enable innovation and variation in others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need a coherent plan to deliver our vision. In &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2018/01/19/focus-solutions.html&quot;&gt;part 3, I discuss the best way to meet these challenges.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This vision is split into four key themes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Information for You”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Supporting professionals”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Improvement and innovation”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“A Planned future”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We want a future where staff, service users, patients and carers are empowered and better informed, where organisational boundaries are not a barrier to effective care, as information is available electronically and joined-up, and where innovation and improvement can flourish built on a solid technical infrastructure and a safe environment for those who work in or are served by health and care services in Wales.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key question for us to answer is, what are the challenges that must be overcome to deliver this vision? As part of that process, we must identify current and future impediments to successful delivery. It is easy to fall into a trap of thinking of the “Informed Health and Care” strategy as an finished product instead of what it is, a set of high level goals which requires us to build a tangible and specific roadmap bringing together multiple strands of work into a truly cohesive vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, we must be honest about the economical and political environment in which we work, acknowledging the limitations in resources. We face a multitude of potentially conflicting demands and interests; as such, delivering the “Informed Health and Care Strategy” requires us to not only understand what we must do to achieve those goals but critically to understand what we must stop doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what is our strategy to deliver the vision?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;difficult-choices--we-cannot-do-it-all&quot;&gt;Difficult choices : we cannot do it all&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NHS Wales must face some difficult choices.  For too long, external factors have resulted in incoherent and inconsistent delivery or projects, frequency orthogonal to delivery of the wider vision; in many cases it has been driven by the budgeting process and the availability of funds in any single financial year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A coherent plan to deliver the strategy needs more than a list of disconnected and incompatible goals but instead a clear understanding of what needs to be done and what doesn’t need to be done; we must know when to say “no”. Instead, we focus our limited resources on specific tangible actions and make some difficult decisions to prune areas of work that do not support delivery of the wider vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… you should have a very short list of the most important things for the company to do. Then you will have a basis for moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters/dp/1846684811&quot;&gt;“Good Strategy Bad Strategy”, 2011 by Richard Rumelt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, we need a coordinated all-Wales approach that permits all stakeholders to work cooperatively and collaboratively with clear lines of responsibility and governance. We need to re-organise our approach to healthcare information technology taking into account the steps needed to deliver the vision, the principles of enterprise architectural design, modern information standards and interoperability, modern quality improvement methodology and user-centred design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that the only logical response to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wao.gov.uk/publication/informatics-systems-nhs-wales&quot;&gt;Welsh Audit Office report&lt;/a&gt; is to re-imagine the relationship between the NHS Wales Informatics Service (NWIS) and the health boards. Such a re-imagining requires us to stop ignoring the, in my view, currently incoherent set of responsibilities and divisions of labour that exist within Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, is NWIS a standards and governance body, a consultancy, a software development house, a provider of a computing platform, a user experience and design shop, a procurement specialist, a business intelligence and analytics service or a provider of information technology infrastructure? Who is responsible? Who takes the credit for successful delivery and who takes the blame when something is not delivered? If we cannot answer such questions, we have to question our governance and organisational structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, while it makes sense that the “Informed Health and Care” strategy is divided into four workstreams, I believe it is incorrect to assume that the safe and efficient delivery of those objectives is necessarily delineated into separate workstreams. Such separation works only if work may continue semi-independently without consideration to other projects. There are, in my opinion, too many common goals and solutions to solve those goals that cross-cut those workstreams to consider them independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, we must consider a “target architecture”, an enterprise master-plan which lays out an overall set of systems and functions that will support delivery of our shared vision. For example, understanding the similarities and differences between providing information for patients or professionals provides important insight into the shared data and software components that must serve both sets of requirements. For example, patients and health professionals need to see past and prior appointments and entries on waiting lists; there is no doubt that there are shared needs that cut across those workstreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, transformational change, enabled by technology, must be driven from the bottom-up, from those who deliver healthcare permitting incremental development and innovation while at the same time lowering risk. When a project is small and developed incrementally in an agile-way, our risk of failure is minimised. Likewise, don’t we all know that we must have top-down governance to ensure that solutions are standards-compliant, fit-for-purpose and safe as well as checking that developments are not orthogonal to the overall strategic vision so eloquently described in four workstreams of the Informed Health and Care Strategy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, we need an all-Wales plan to deliver the vision that balances the need for centralised planning and yet enables local innovation. The paradox, put simply, is that currently we appear to have centralised the day-to-day management and delivery of individual projects and yet high-level strategic and prioritisation decisions are decentralised, haphazard and dependant on capital funding with little or no consideration or control as to how those projects will fit into a wider technical all-Wales architecture. We have, in essence, failed to create a plan to delivery the strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;/clinical-informatics/2018/01/19/focus-challenges.html&quot;&gt;part 2 of this series, I discuss the challenges that we face in NHS Wales in delivering the vision in our strategy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
